					<dc:description>This paper examines recent debates about reproductive policy in Singapore by examining the responses of two different groups of women - women Members of Parliament and feminist activists. Women currently make up 10% of MPs in Singapore. Although this figure is low when compared to average rates of female representation globally, it is the highest level in Singapore since Independence. All these women are members of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in power since 1959. While publicly supportive of the view of the PAP male elite, this group of women has introduced a level of critique into reproductive policy not previously seen by the Singapore public. Local women's groups too have played a visible role in public debates about population policy. The feminist group, the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) has had a long interest in reproductive policy issues and released its own position paper to address the government's recent policy making. This paper examines the responses of these two groups of women towards the PAP's pro-natalist stance. It explores the extent to which these women have challenged the PAP as well as the obstacles to an independent feminist voice on population matters</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper will address the role of the recent implementation of systems of research evaluation in universities. The role of classic quality control system, the peer review, is to produce the most trustworthy knowledge and at the same time function as a learning system in a peer-to-peer learning process based on the norms of science. Scientific work was and to a large degree still is organized as a craft guild with an apprenticeship kind of training function for young scientists, who tacitly have accepted the authoritative hierarchical system normally associated with organizations one or two centuries ago. Recent studies of knowledge creation and learning in organizational learning theory have demonstrated the complexity of the process of knowledge in organizations. But in the university the very accidental and random model for learning is still state of the art, leaving the important learning decisions in relation to knowledge and learning to the individual scientist and not to the organization, the research group or the university. These individualized and unorganized learning systems are at the same time confronted with a much more systematically organized system of research evaluation. The basic question is what will become of the classic internal and tacit modes of learning science by day to day training of young scientists, when new models of research evaluation introduces new forms of governance in universities as a response to policy demands.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Two of Herbert Simon's best-known papers are "The Architecture of Complexity" and "The Structure of Ill-Structured Problems." We discuss the neglected links between these two papers, highlighting the role of decomposition in the context of problems on which constraints have been imposed as a general approach to problem solving. We apply these Simonian ideas to organizational issues, specifically new organizational forms. Specifically, Simonian ideas allow us to develop a morphology of new organizational forms and to point to some design problems that characterize these forms.Keywords: Herbert Simon, problem-solving, new organizational forms.

					<dc:description>The computer IC is the heart of the information and telecommunication technology. It is a tiny artifact, but with incredible organizing powers. We use this physical artifact as the location for studying central problems of the knowledge economy. First, the paper describes the history of chip design and the emergence of the technological community involved in designing and manufacturing computer chips. The community is structured in a way that reflects the underlying physical nature silicon and the numerous other materials and chemicals involved. But it also reflects the human agency of defining new projects, of visioning the liberation from atoms, of committing to travel many detours in the labyrinths of development, and of perceiving and exploring the affordance that new technologies hide. Some of these characteristics are analyzed empirically in a case study of designing a chip for a digitalized hearing instrument. It is found that technological progress is not hindered, but rather aided by the use of imperfect principles, abstractions and representations of reality. The power of such imperfections is discussed and generalized.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper examines how basic cognitive processes lead to the non-recognition of processes that lead to or sustain gender inequality in the Information technology sector. The paper is based on empirical research carried out in Sweden and Ireland from 2001-2004. The central thesis is that "delusions" about gender equality in the IT sector are sustained by positional factors (governing what one can see from a vantage point and what type of data one can, and one is encouraged to, gather and process); ideological factors (how information is "fit" into pre-existing frameworks to which one has political or organizational commitments) and more rudimentary processes of "optical socialization" (Zerubavel) and "good reasons for holding false beliefs" (Boudon). A series of "delusions" found in empirical research are described and analysed. The paper concludes by sketching out how such cognitive hindrances and barriers can be overcome within organizations, and how this could lead to a greater recognition of the processes facilitating or causing gender inequality in a branch that frequently sees itself as "gender neutral" as well as measures to actively promote gender equality. Keywords: gender inequality, Information Technology, management, delusions, cognition</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Does the RBV represent a case of scientific progress? And has it emerged as the dominant approach to the analysis of competitive advantage for this reason? Conventional criteria for scientific progress, notably those of the growth of knowledge literature, are not particularly helpful for understanding this. Instead, it is argued that in order to understand why the RBV is an instance of scientific progress, we should begin from the notion that reduction is at the heart of progress in science, and that many scientists implicitly or explicitly hold this view. The RBV is a case of scientific progress because it identified theoretical mechanisms at levels lower than those that were usually investigated in strategy research prior to the RBV. Unfortunately, the micro-emphasis of the RBV gave way during the 1990s to more aggregative modes of theorizing (i.e., the capabilities approach). Thus, the RBV represents an "unfinished revolution" as there is still considerable potential to dig deeper in the deep structure of competitive advantage.

					<dc:description>Multinational enterprise in control of dispersed overseas resources and capabilities has been linked to strategic flexibility that allows the firm to take advantage of opportunities and manage exposures imposed by changing environmental conditions. This paper analyzes the implied performance and risk management effects in a comprehensive sample of public firms and finds supportive evidence for the proposition that multinationality can enhance performance across industries. However, the ability to exploit upside potential and avoid downside risk is industry specific. The positive effects of multinationality are found particularly pronounced among firms operating in knowledge intensive service industries while firms in capital-intensive primary industries display the inverse relationships.

					<dc:description>Research on companies' internationalization has mainly focused on firm-level and country-level factors in order to explain firms' cross-border activities. With the exception of a limited number of studies emphasizing rivalistic behavior in oligopolistic industries, industry factors have been neglected as potential determinants of companies' internationalization. We argue that differences across industries with regard to competition level, research intensity, tangibility of the products, and the existence of clusters should influence the impetus and opportunities to internationalize. This study examines the role of such factors using data covering the internationalization patterns of the 100 largest non-financial Norwegian companies over the period 1990 to 2000. We find that industry factors contribute significantly to explaining the internationalization of these companies, and that the effects of industry factors remain strong when firm-level characteristics are taken into account.

					<dc:description>The IB literature informs us of several ways to measure firms' degree of internationalization. In this paper we make the argument that in fact none of the existing indices really measure firms' degree of "global specialization", that is, to what extent their allocation of resources is multidomestic or global. As argued, all the existing measures may gauge a purely multidomestic firm as having a high degree of internationalization, whereas a truly global firm may be ranked low. In order to remedy this we introduce a complementary index measuring how firms are configuring their value chains - whether they are replicating value chain activities from country to country or locating them in globally specialized units in order to exploit an international division of labor. In addition to mathematical modeling and numerical examples, we examine the relevance of the new index of global specialization on data of Danish MNCs by looking at the correlation between the new global specialization index and existing indices of firms' degree of internationalization. We find that the index is able to identify a distinct group of firms with significantly higher degrees of global value chain configuration. Key words: Internationalization, value chain, global configuration. JEL Codes: F02, F23, L22, L23</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The study explores how firms close their knowledge gaps in relation to business environments of foreign markets. Potential determinants are derived from traditional internationalization process theory as well as more recent literature on organizational learning processes, including the concept of absorptive capacity. Building on these two literature streams a conceptual model is developed and tested on a set of primary data of Danish firms and their foreign market operations. The empirical study suggests that factors considered essential in traditional internationalization process theory, such as experiential learning, explains only a very limited part of perceived knowledge gaps. When factors pertaining to the concepts of absorptive capacity and superstitious learning are added, the explanatory power improves significantly. Apparently, our understanding of firms' internationalization processes can be enriched by insights from organizational learning literature. Key words: Internationalization, knowledge gap, absorptive capacity, superstitious learning. JEL Codes: D21, F23, M10</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Credible delegation of discretion obtains when it is a rational strategy for managers not to overrule employee decisions that are based on delegated decision rights or renege on the level of delegated discretion (and this is common knowledge). Making delegation of discretion credible becomes a crucial issue when organizations want to sustain the advantages that may flow from delegation: Such advantages are dependent on motivated employees, and managerial overruling or reneging is harmful to motivation. However, little work has been done on how organizations can make delegation credible. We argue that key elements of organizations (i.e., organizational structure, coordination mechanisms, reward structures, and interdependencies between activities) and how these fit influence the credibility of delegation. Fit configurations of organizational elements reduce the probability of managerial intervention that may harm employee motivation. This introduces a neglected incentive dimension to the organizational design literature. Moreover, it is argued that harmful intervention may be reduced by increasing managers' costs of intervening.

					<dc:description>Abstract This paper argues that knowledge sharing can be conceptualized as different situations of exchange in which individuals relate to each other in different ways, involving different rules, norms and traditions of reciprocity regulating the exchange. The main challenge for facilitating knowledge sharing is to ensure that the exchange is seen as equitable for the parties involved, and by viewing the problems of knowledge sharing as motivational problems situated in different organizational settings, the paper explores how knowledge exchange can be conceptualized as going on in four distinct situations of exchange denominated organizational exchange yielding extrinsic rewards, organizational exchange yielding intrinsic rewards, financial exchange, and social exchange. The paper argues that each situation of exchange has distinct assumptions about individual behaviour and the intermediaries regulating the exchange, and facilitating knowledge sharing should therefore be viewed as a continuum of practices under the influence of opportunistic behaviour, obedience or organizational citizenship behaviour. Keywords: Knowledge sharing, motivation, organizational settings, situations of exchange.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We develop a new rating of mutual funds: the atpRating. The atpRating assigns crowns to each individual mutual fund based upon the costs an investor pays when investing in the fund in relation to what it would cost to invest in the fund's peers. Within each investment category, the rating assigns five crowns to funds with the lowest costs and one crown to funds with the highest costs. We investigate the ability of the atpRating to predict the future performance of a fund. We find that an investor who has invested in the funds with the lowest costs within an investment category would have obtained an annual risk-adjusted excess return that is approximately 3-4 percentage points higher per annum than if the funds with the highest costs had been invested in. We compare the atpRating with the Morningstar Rating. We show that one reason why the atpRating and the Morningstar Rating contain different information is that the returns Morningstar uses as inputs when rating funds are highly volatile whereas the costs the atpRating uses as inputs when rating funds are highly persistent. In other words, a fund that has low costs one year will most likely also have low costs the following year, whereas the return of a fund in a certain year generally contains only little information about the future return that the fund will generate. Finally, we have information on the investments in different mutual funds made by a small subgroup of investors known to have been exposed to both the atpRating and the Morningstar Rating, i.e. information is provided on how investors use the two ratings. We find that investors have a clear preference for high-rated funds.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper studies the impact of outsourcing on individual wages. In contrast to the standard approach in the literature, we focus on domestic outsourcing as well as foreign outsourcing. By using a simple theoretical model, we argue that, if outsourcing is associated with specialization gains arising from an increase in the extent of the market for intermediate goods, domestic outsourcing tends to increase wages for both unskilled and skilled labor. We use a panel data set of workers in Danish manufacturing industries to show that domestic and foreign outsurcing affect wages as predicted by the theory.Keywords: Outsourcing, Comparative advantage, Specialization, Wages.JEL Classification: F16, J31, C23.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Purpose: To incorporate the element of sustainability of advantages into the concept ofFirst-Mover Advantage for analysis on grocery e-commerce. Grocery e-commerce is a relatively unexplored phenomenon in Denmark and I seek to explain this via the concept of FMA. In order to fully understand the complexity of the situation, sustainability of advantages needs to be incorporated into the concept. Design: Via a literature review on the subject of first-mover advantage, uncover the lack of sustainability of advantage.Hereafter construct a framework for analysis based on this literature review and coupled with previous empirical findings on grocery e-commerce. Findings: a) Providing insights into the concept of first- mover advantage, b) sustainability of advantages and c) providing a framework for analysis on advantages sought by acting entrepreneurial. Value: The applicability of the concept of first-mover advantage is very descriptive to date. With thispaper and hopefully more to follow, I wish to transform the FMA concepts into a tool for analysis addressing the very crucial element that is not dealt with today - sustainability.Keywords : First-Mover Advantage; e-commerce; grocery industry; sustainability</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Den foreliggende rapport bygger på en analyse af 871 huskesedler. Sedlerne er dels indsamlet i Jylland og dels i København. Indsamlingen af forbrugernes kasserede huskesedler er foregået såvel inde i dagligvarebutikkerne (indkøbskurve, affaldsspande) som ude foran butikkerne (parkeringsplads, indkøbsvogne). Dataindsamlingen omfatter de største supermarkeder og discountbutikker samt Bilka.Det vedhæftede appendiks forenden indeholder en nærmere redegørelse for den anvendte metodiske fremgangsmåde.Da produkter på en indkøbsseddel ofte er uklart beskrevet ("frugt" "grønt", "diverse pålæg", "weekendguf" osv.) har vi valgt at betegne hver nedfældning, der er protokolleret på papir, som et vareemne eller et indkøbsforsæt. "2 Agurker" og "Rød Merrild, 23,95" er ret præcist beskrevet, hvilket "frugt", "diverse pålæg" eller "morgenmad" ikke just kan siges at være. Medens en indkøbsseddel giver fuld mening og kan "afkodes" af medlemmerne af den pågældende husstand, kan den virke indforstået og delvis uforståelig for udenforstående. Øl er måske ensbetydende med den ramme med 6 Tuborg, som man plejer at købe, "frugt" kan være synonym med bananer, æbler og appelsiner, husstandens tre foretrukne frugter osv. De 871 huskesedler indeholdt i gennemsnit lidt over 9 vareemner. Medens der er store udsving, gælder at flertallet af huskesedler indeholder mellem 3 og 15 vareemner. Der er dog en spredning i opadgående retning. En huskeseddel indeholdt faktisk 60 emner. Se Figur 2 forneden i appendiks.Samlet rummede de 871 sedler 8047 vareemner. Skønsvist drejer det sig om mellem 600 og 800 forskellige produkter. Det præcise tal lader sig ikke helt fastlægge, idet visse vareemner ("grønt", "pålæg" og "tøj" osv. i modsætning til agurker, hamburgerryg og Adidas T-shirt XL) ikke tillader identifikation af et specifikt produkt. Dertil kommer af 542 emner fordelt over 262 sedler ikke kunne identificeres positivt (ulæseligt).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Magt er et pudsigt fænomen. Det er et fænomen, vi alle umiddelbart kender til, et fænomen vi alle lader til at genkende, når vi støder på det. Et fænomen, vi laver undersøgelser af, som vi søger at 'udrede' og 'indfange' for derved at kunne kontrollere det, der kontrollerer os. Men magt er også et fænomen, vi ikke synes at kunne begribe. Ikke alene er magt ofte et tabu i kommunikationen, noget vi undlader at tale om - et sprængfarligt fænomen, vi ikke tør nærme os. Men magten er også i sig selv et svært tilnærmeligt fænomen. Det er ikke til at hitte rede i, hvori magten egentlig består. Det er ikke så ligetil at udrede magten. Dette paper tilbyder en måde at iagttage magt på. Det præsenterer en analytik, hvormed det bliver muligt at begribe dette ubegribelige fænomen. Paperet lancerer en teoretisk udfoldelse af magtbegrebet, men antager først og fremmest en analysestrategisk karakter, hvor bidraget er at levere en strategi til, hvordan magt kan iagttages og analyseres. Dens sigte er at fungere som fundament for konkrete magtanalyser af organisationer og ledelsesrelationer. Paperet stiller skarpt på spørgsmålet om, hvordan man kan iagttage socialiteten og kommunikationen med et magtblik. Hvad får man øje på, når man anretter et magtens blik, hvori består et sådant magtblik og hvilken grundproblematik og genstand kaster det af sig?</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Communication makes a difference. The manner in which we communicate creates the phenomena we communicate about. It can seem obvious, but we are nevertheless seldom aware of the complexity this constructivist assumption implies. Through an analysis of a new salary system in the public sector of Denmark (called New Wage), this paper theorizes this complexity in terms of Niklas Luhmann's systems theory. It identifies four wholly different `codes' of communication: legal, economic, pedagogical and intimate. Each of them shapes the phenomena of `pay', the construal of the employee and the form of management differently. In this chaos of codes the managerial challenge is to take a second order position in order to strategically manage the communication that manages management itself. Key words: Management; personnel management; human-relations; pay-system; communication; system-theory; discursive epistemology</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In the following we will analyse the sale of alcohol in Denmark. Various figures related to this question are published by Statistics Denmark at different frequencies. Our main concern will be with quarterly data for the sale of beer, wine and spirits from the period 1990 - 2004. Our two hypotheses are: First we want to convince the reader that the total sale of alcohol in Denmark since 1980 has been fairly stable. By total sale we mean the total sale of 100% alcohol so the three categories - beer, wine and spirits are measured in litres of 100% alcohol equivalents. In order to convince the reader that the total sale of alcohol has been fairly constant we will present graphs and various indicators and tests of the degree of temporal dependence in this series. The overall impression from this analysis is that our first hypothesis seems to be supported - at least not contradicted - by the data. Next, we want to model the sale of beer and wine as shares of the total sale of alcohol. Even though the total sale can be considered fairly stable there have been divergent paths of evolvement for the sub-groups: the sale of beer has decreased over the period and the sale of wine has increased. The sale of spirits has been fairly stable. Modelling the system of the beer-share and the wine-share we want to split the total development into a part that can be ascribed to changes in the relative prices and a part that can be explained by changes in taste and drinking habits specified as a trend. By specifying a system conditionally on the prices of beer, wine and spirits and a trend we manage to estimate price sensitivity and taste sensitivity. A small forecasting exercise shows that the final model is fairly good at predicting changes in the shares due to price changes. Finally, the effects on the market shares of hypothetical changes in the taxation of alcohol are discussed.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>It may be optimal from a welfare perspective to use R&amp;D subsidies when the source of R&amp;D distortions originates from the surplus appropriability problem and technological spillovers in the form of knowledge spillovers, creative destruction, and duplication externalities are absent. Hence, R&amp;D subsidies may constitute the optimal policy even when subsidies directly targeted on monopoly pricing could be applied. The result holds when dynamic effects are important relative to static effects and when governments spending is restricted. The latter characteristic arises when a government is unable or unwilling to use the level of spending required to implement the optimum policy. The argument is developed in a semi-endogenous growth model where the only distortion is monopoly pricing of intermediate goods.Keywords: R&amp;D, policy instruments, welfare, market powerJEL: O38, O41</dc:description>

					<dc:title>A Note on the (In)stability of Diamond's Growth Model</dc:title>

					<dc:description>Diamond's two-period OLG growth model is based on the assumption that the stock of capital in any period is equal to the wealth accumulated in the previous period by the generation of pensioners. This stock equlibrium condition may appear an innocuous paraphrase of the ordinary macro-economic flow equilibrium condition, S = I.This is not the case. In this note I demonstrate that Diamond's solution is unstable in a monetary market economy where households and firms make independent decisions as to how much to save and how much to invest. An increase in the rate of interest above the Diamond long-run equilibrium level will cause saving to fall by more than investment and, hence, result in excess demand for loanable funds and an upward pressure on the rate of interest. However, substituting the ordinary S = I flow equilibrium condition for Diamonds stock equilibrium condition reveals that the model has another solution - the rate of interest equals the rate of growth - and that this solution is stable in a capital-based economy (contrary to the pure consumption loan model of interest suggested by Samuelson(1958)). The model has interesting implications. Diamond's model predict that an increase in rate of time preference causing the young generation to save less will reduce the capital stock and raise the rate of interest. However,the S = I based two period OLG model reveals that the old generation's consumption falls by more than the the young generation's consumption increases. Consequently, excess supply of loanable funds will drive down the rate of interest. If the rate of interest is equal to the rate of growth an increase in the time preference has no effect on the supply of loanable funds and, consequently, neither on the rate of interest or the stock of capital. Whether people prefer to consume as young or old should not be a matter of public concern (although the transition from one state to another may be).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In the economics literature, various views on the likely (efficiency) effects of information exchange,communication between firms and market transparency present themselves. Often these views oninformation flows are highly conflicting. On the one hand, it is argued that increased informationdissemination improves firm planning to the benefit of society (including customers) and/or allowspotential customers to make the right decisions given their preferences. On the other hand, theliterature also suggests that increased information dissemination can have significant coordinating orcollusive potential to the benefit of firms but at the expense of society at large (mainly, potentialcustomers). In this chapter, we try to make sense of these views, with the aim of presenting somesimple lessons for antitrust practice. In addition, the chapter presents some cases, from both sides ofthe Atlantic, where informational issues have played a significant role.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Samuelson (1958) analyses a three-period model, whereas Diamod (1965) considers a two-period model. This difference poses the question whether the insights derived by analysing the simple two-period model carry over in the more complicated three-period case. They do. The Samuelson model (no productive capital) has only one positive solution (r = n); however, this root is unstable. The Diamond model (no nonproductive abode of purchasing power) has also only one positive solution; the root is stable but inefficient. In a model with both productive capital and a non-productive abode of purchasing power, the inefficient Diamond solution becomes unstable and the socially optimal solution becomes stable.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper studies labour market policy in a society where differently gifted individuals can invest in training to further increase their labour market productivity and where the government seeks both effiency and equity. Frictions in the matching process create unemployment and differently skilled workers face different unemployment risks. We show that in such an environment, training programmes that are targeted to the unemployed complement passive transfers (UI benefits), unlike a general training subsidy. Combining passive subsidies with a training subsidy conditioned on the individual being unemployed (for a while) - the typical Active Labour Market Programme - implies a favorable trade-off between equity and efficiency which encourages high spending on training.</dc:description>

Within a simple model that emphasizes the multiple conflicting roles of transfer prices in MNEs - here, as a strategic pre-commitment device and a tax manipulation instrument -, we show that (de-)centralized decisions are more profitable when tax differentials are (small) large.Keywords: Centralized vs. de-centralized decisions, taxes, MNEs.JEL-Classification: H25, F23, L23.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper explores how two Danish rehabilitation organizations textual guidelines for assessment of clients' personality traits influence the actual evaluation of clients. The analysis will show how staff members produce institutional identities corresponding to organizational categories, which very often have little or no relevance for the clients evaluated. The goal of the article is to demonstrate how the institutional complex that frames the work of the organizations produces the client types pertaining to that organization. By applying the analytical strategy of institutional ethnography I elucidate how the two rehabilitation organizations local history, legislation, structural features of the present labour market and of social work result in a number of contradictions which make it difficult to deliver client-centred care. This exact goal is according to the staff one of the most important goals for `good' social work.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in the voluntary organisations that play an important and innovative part in the development of the welfare societies in America (se Salamon 1995;1997; Alexander, Nank and Stivers C. 1999; Reisch and Sommerfeld 2003), England (se Plowden 2003) and Scandinavian (se&amp;hellip;.) . The states, in particular, has realised that a number of welfare tasks cannot be solved without establishing a close working relationship with the existing voluntary social sector. The added political interest has led to greater awareness of the structuralisation of voluntary organisations and their supply of services. At the same time, we know very little today about the practical functions of volunteers - what is it they do and know, and how may this possibly differ from what others do and know. We are also in need of studies to highlight the relationship between the practices of volunteers and the voluntary organisations which initially facilitated the development of such practices. The need for such information is growing in step with the ever-increasing demands placed on the practices of volunteers by society in general and politicians in particular. Using Niklas Luhmann's theory of social systems as a springboard, this article will look at the state's expectations for new and more integrated forms of cooperation with the voluntary organisations. These expectations are interesting precisely because the bodies that are seeking to cooperate have very different ways of organising the provision of social services. Using a specially selected area of user-cantered voluntary social services, the article will examine the unique aspects of voluntary work, as well as the unique way in which the voluntary organisations organise and manage this work. The article will argue that the voluntary work represent a interaction system, and that the organisation which instigates the voluntary social work neither has access to it, nor control over it. The article will therefore show that there is another, far more controversial side to voluntary social services than the state's attempts to formulate a joint voluntary service policy. Voluntary organisations risk becoming embaressed. On the basis of this argument, the article will pinpoint a number of risks associated with the attempt to formalise cooperation between public and voluntary social services. What are the risks for the people towards whom these services are directed? What are the risks for the voluntary organisations? And what are the risks for the social policies of the welfare state, based as they are on the principle of universalism?</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The topic of social work does not normally inspire laughter. So it is perhaps not surprising that research into the culture of social work rarely pursues its humorous aspect&amp;mdash;the role of irony and laughter, for example. But if Michael Mulkay (1988) is right in suggesting that the domain of humor allows contradictory worlds to coexist, then this topic warrants a closer look. After all, no one would deny that social work involves a measure of contradiction.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We investigate the possibility of an arbitrage free model for the term structure of interest rates where the yield curve only changes through a parallel shift. We consider HJM type forward rate models driven by a multidimensionalWiener process as well as by a general marked point process. Within this general framework we show that there does indeed exist a large variety of nontrivial parallel shift term structure models, and we also describe these in detail. We also show that there exists no nontrivial flat term structure model. The same analysis is repeated for the similar case, where the yield curve only changes through proportional shifts.Key words: bond market, term structure of interest rates, flat term structures.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The process of globalization is opening new windows for Danish initiatives. The requirement for innovation and development of new areas as a consequence of the globalization will lead to radical changes and the IT businesses need to take active part in the development. But in order to understand and explain the globalization process we also have to understand the limitations. One such limitation is found in the global digitalization of information- and communication processes. This global development requires, from the world citizens, literacy in use of computers. The majority of the world populations are illiterates, they are not only technical illiterates but also illiterates in the traditional sense: they cannot read and write, however, the global ICT development largely disregards the problem with illiteracy and cultural differences. It seems that a future area of growth for the Danish IT business with their specific competencies may be to strengthen the user oriented and interdisciplinary approaches to design and development of ICT applications - targeted to specific cultural groups and the illiterates - in developing countries and also to large groups of immigrants in the developed world. India is an example of the global structural changes. India has developed an impressive ICT industry and has a very high level of expertise in software engineering. India's government has a vision for e-democracy and have implemented e-government systems, which also address the rural populations. But the Indian population is very large and the potential users are highly diverse groups of which many are illiterate. Denmark has an IT industry that supplements India's, e.g. a strong expertise in e-government, and ICT for the agriculture. Denmark has a long tradition for cooperation between IT developers, researchers and users and is strong in interdisciplinary approaches to development and design of ICT applications. Denmark also has a tradition for a human centred design, and usability is seen as a competitive factor. In India usability is on the agenda in only few IT companies, and it is also new to the academic world (Pradeep Y. 2004). Copenhagen Business School, department of Informatics has for the last 18 months been involved in the establishment of a Euro-India Centre. The departments research group on human-computer interaction(HCI) has prioritized HCI work in the Asian world for the last 4 years (Clemmensen 2004, Nielsen Janni 2004, Nielsen, Clemmensen and Yssing 2002, Levinsen, K. 2002, Nielsen, Lene and Gregers Koch 2003). The wish for a collaborative network has come about as a result of meetings and discussions between researchers from especially India and Denmark and also from Great Britain and Sweden. The first Indian conference on HCI in December 2004 and the initiative from CBS, department of Informatics in May 2005 where an Indian - European workshop was held, created the basis for this network application.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The focus is effects of investments in airports and runways on the market for air travel and more in general for the production possibilities of the economy. In the case of Greenland two types of impacts can be sorted out. One is more efficient production of air transport due to increased density in the utilization of the net because of no use or less use of the airport in Kangerlussuaq. The other effect, connected to the first, is that resources are set free by avoidance of double work receiving the same passengers (and goods) in Kangerlussuaq and especially in Nuuk. Transformation curves are used to illustrate both effects and the first is dealt with also in an ordinary price quantity diagram. Using previous calculations and estimates done by the author two specific scenarios are treated in the theoretical framework presented: one is a lengthening of the runway in Nuuk to 1799 m and less intensive use of Kangerlussuaq, the other is the building of an airport south of Nuuk with a 3000 m runway in combination with abandoning Kangerlussuaq. Profitability and amortisation of the investments are reviewed in transformation curve diagrams. On the assumptions of the calculationsboth scenarios are profitable, but by far the most profitable is the big investment south of Nuuk. Concluding remarks stress the preliminary character of my calculations, but they also point out that decision makers' choice of scenarios to be discussed and compared is unstable.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Liberalizations of international trade and improvements in communication and information technologies allow companies to organize around extensive multinational structures of cross-border sourcing networks. In a freely interacting market setting multinational enterprise is exposed to financial and economic risks that can be monitored within conventional reporting systems and managed through use of various derivative instruments. All the while, a dispersed multinational structure can be vulnerable to disruptions caused by changing economic conditions, competitive moves, and geopolitical developments as well as natural disasters and terrorist events that are difficult to forecast. Consequently, current risk management techniques span from conventional gap analyses and quantitative value-at-risk measures of market-related exposures to more qualitative assessments of competitive exposures and low-frequency high-impact disaster events based on scenario analyses. Hence, there is a need to consider risk management approaches that integrate relatively transparent financial exposures with the consequences of uncertain and hard-to-quantify event risks. This paper outlines the contours of such a strategic risk management framework incorporating conventional exposure measures and simulation techniques to assess vulnerability and responsiveness in a turbulent global setting.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Previous research found that capital structure affects performance when it is adapted to the level of environmental dynamism and pursuit of an innovation strategy. The current study reproduces some of these relationships in a more recent dataset but also identifies significant nuances across industrial environments. Analyses of a large cross sectional sample and various industry sub-samples suggest that other factors have influenced capital structure effects in recent years including flexibilities in multinational organization and effective strategic risk management capabilities.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>An attempt is made to characterize a `knowledge governance approach' as a distinctive, emerging field that cuts across the fields of knowledge management, organisation studies, strategy and human resource management. Knowledge governance is taken up with how the deployment of administrative apparatus influences knowledge processes, such as sharing, retaining and creating knowledge. It insists on clear behavioural foundations, adopts an economizing perspective and examines efficient alignment between knowledge transactions with diverse characteristics and governance structures and mechanisms with diverse capabilities of handling these transactions. Various open research issues that a knowledge governance approach may illuminate are sketched. Although knowledge governance draws clear inspiration from organizational economics and `rational' organization theory, it recognizes that knowledge represents various challenges to more `closed' social science disciplines, notably economics.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Systems risk refers to the likelihood that an IS is inadequately guarded against certain types of damage or loss. While risks are posed by acts of God, hackers and viruses, consideration should also be given to the `insider' threat of dishonest employees, intent on undertaking some form of computer abuse. Against this backdrop, a number of researchers have addressed the extent to which security managers are cognizant of the very nature of systems risk. In particular, they note how security practitioners' knowledge of local threats, which form part of such risk, is often fragmented. This contributes to situations where risk reducing efforts are often less than effective. Security efforts are further complicated given that the task of managing systems risk requires input from a number of departments including, for example, HR, compliance, IS/IT and physical security. In a bid to complement existing research, but also offer a fresh perspective, this paper addresses systems risk from the offender's perspective. If systems risk entails the likelihood that an IS is inadequately protected, this text considers those conditions, within the organisational context, which offer a criminal opportunity for the offender. To achieve this goal a model known as the `Crime Specific Opportunity Structure' is advanced. Focussing on the opportunities for computer abuse, the model addresses the nature of such opportunities with regards to the organisational context and the threats posed by rogue employees. Drawing on a number of criminological theories, it is believed the model may help inform managers about local threats and, by so doing, enhance safeguard implementation.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>IS security represents a growing concern for organisations. Although hackers and viruses are often the basis of such concerns, the inside threat of employee computer crime should not be underestimated. From an academic perspective, there are a modest but growing number of texts which examine the `insider' problem. While attention has been given to the influence on offender actions through deterrent safeguards, there has been a lack of insight into the interactive relationship between offender choices made during the actual perpetration of computer crimes, and the context in which such crimes take place. Knowledge of this relationship would be of obvious interest to practitioners who would aim to manipulate the environment and influence offender choices accordingly. To address this oversight, this paper, therefore, advances two criminological theories which it is argued can be used to examine the stages an offender must go through in order for a crime to be committed i.e. the `procedural stages' of computer crime. Hence, this paper illustrates how the two theories, entitled the rational choice perspective and situational crime prevention, can be applied to the IS domain, thereby offering a theoretical basis on which to analyse offender choices/behaviour during perpetration. Through such an analysis greater insights may be offered into selecting appropriate safeguards to prevent computer crime.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Firms pay out cash using both dividends and share repurchases. In many aspects these twomeans are similar, but one important difference is that dividends are generally taxed more heavily than share repurchases. Nevertheless firms persist in paying out large amounts in dividends. This paper provides an explanation for this dividend puzzle by developing a class of signaling models violating the `single-crossing' property in which information about the quality of the firm is asymmetric between the management and the shareholders. In these models a high-quality firm can always signal its quality by using share repurchases only. However, in certain cases share repurchases become costlier on the margin for a high-quality firm than for a low-quality imitator. In such cases, the high-quality firm signals most cost efficiently by means of a combination of share repurchases and taxable cash dividends financed by the issuance of new shares. Taxable cash dividends financed by the issuance of new shares then can be considered a positive kind of money burning whose role is to signal a firm's high quality. The implications of the models are consistent with several important empirical facts about dividends and share repurchases. Thus, this paper's main contribution is to examine a range of new signaling models that provides a role for taxable cash dividends and share repurchases and to derive their empirical implications.Key words: Dividends, Share Repurchases, Signaling, Single-Crossing Property, Money BurningJEL Classification: G35, D82</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Til belysning af Batailles såkaldte generelle økonomi redegøres for nogle grundlæggende præmisser for økonomi og for kritikken af dem. det vises hvordan Bataille inddrager energiens kredsløb gennem univers, natur og samfund i økonomien, ligesom han fastholder det subjektive begær i den indre erfarings perspektiv. Der redegøres for Bataille genrelle økonomi som politisk økonomi, og den sammenlignes med post-moderne begrundelser for hhv. forbrugskapitalisme og begærs kommunisme. Det vises, at Bataille undslipper dem begge, men at den generelle økonomi som politisk økonomi er et modsigelsesfyldt og umuligt projekt.</dc:description>

					<dc:title>En model for lagerstørrelsen som determinant for købs- og brugsadfærden for et kortvarigt forbrugsgode</dc:title>

					<dc:description>Mange kortvarige forbrugsgoder har den egenskab, at de ikke nødvendigvis forbruges i den periode, hvor de købes, fordi det er muligt for forbrugeren at lægge dem på lager til senere brug. Dette gælder fx for varer som kaffe, te, øl, spiritus, læskedrikke, sæbe, vaskepulver, hårshampoo, tandpasta, papirvarer og konserves. For denne type varer er det klart, at den aktuelle størrelse af forbrugerens lager (dvs. beholdning af varen) som hovedregel vil spille en afgørende rolle for hans købs- og brugsadfærd i en given periode. Dette forhold kommer eksempelvis implicit til udtryk, når man i kvantitative modeller for en virksomheds afsætning og/eller markedsandel finder en signifikant effekt ikke kun af den aktuelle pris for varen, men også af prisen for varen i én eller flere tidligere perioder. Se fx Birch, Olsen og Tjur (2005).En sådan effekt er imidlertid kun en indirekte effekt. Den direkte determinant for forbrugerens købs- og brugsadfærd er ikke prisen for varen i en tidligere periode (som man jo ikke kan købe indtil mere i den aktuelle periode), men derimod størrelsen af forbrugerens lager af varen på det tidspunkt, hvor købet og forbruget realiseres. Men det er klart, at størrelsen af det aktuelle lager vil være bestemt af prisen for varen i én eller flere tidligere perioder. Endvidere er det klart, at prisen for varen - ikke kun i én forudgående periode, men i en lang række forudgående perioder - vil være en indikator for, om prisen for varen i den aktuelle periode er høj eller lav. Det sidstnævnte forhold vil vi dog se bort fra i det følgende.Problemstillingen i denne artikel er herefter at opstille en model for forbrugerens købs- og brugsadfærdfor et kortvarigt forbrugsgode, hvor den aktuelle størrelse af forbrugerens lager af varen gøres til direkte determinant for hans adfærd. Foruden størrelsen af det aktuelle lager af varen vil vi inddrage den aktuelle pris for varen som determinant for forbrugerens købsadfærd. Når vi kun inddrager denne ene beslutningsvariabel i modellen, skyldes det alene ønsket om at simplificere fremstillingen. Modellen opbygges nemlig således, at den umiddelbart vil kunne generaliseres, ved at der inddrages yderligere forklarende variable for købs- og brugsadfærden i den, fx virksomhedenssalgsindsats og konkurrenternes pris og salgsindsats.En tilsvarende problemstilling har hyppigt været behandlet i den afsætningsøkonomiske litteratur.Se fx Jain and Vilcassim (1991) for en grundig litteraturgennemgang og modelsammenligning. Men de benyttede modeller har et noget andet udgangspunkt end vort. Dels fordi modellerne er modeller for ventetiden mellem to på hinanden følgende køb af varen. Eksempelvis eksponentialfordelingen og den negative binomialfordeling (Ehrenberg (1959)), Erlangfordelingen (Herniter(1971), Zufryden (1978), Jeuland, Bass and Wright (1980) og Gupta (1988)) og Cox's hazard model (Jain and Vilcassim (1991)). Dels fordi det aktuelle lager af varen kun indgår indirekte i modelkonstruktionen via størrelsen af det købte kvantum ved forrige køb. Den model, vi vil opstille i det følgende, er i modsætning til ovennævnte modeller en model for antal købte enheder af varen i en given periode, hvor størrelsen af det aktuelle lager af varen indgår eksplicit i modelkonstruktionen.Fordelen ved denne modelformulering er, at man får mulighed for at bestemme sandsynlighedsfordelingenfor størrelsen af forbrugernes lager af varen på et givet tidspunkt.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Udgangspunktet for dette working paper vil være en række teoriområder, som er valgt ud fra den opfattelse, at de er centrale repræsentanter for udviklingen indenfor det erhvervsøkonomiske genstandsområde - med såvel aktuel som potentiel værdi for overvejelser og beslutninger vedrørende indtrængning på internationale markeder. Udviklingen i de udvalgte teoriområder vil have form af en kronologisk redegørelse, hvor der fokuseres på deres forudsætninger, indhold og anvendelse samt potentielle relevans og betydning for indtrængningsproblematikken. Dette giver mulighed for at arbejde med teorierne på metaplan samtidigt med, at forskningen kan vurderes i forhold til K.B. Madsens almene metateori, Karl Poppers falsifikationsprincip, Imre Lakatos' forskningsprogrammer samt Thomas Kuhns paradigme-begreb.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The market penetration problematic has been subject to consideration in the scientific literature, however, hitherto not on the basis of a coherent and applied theory. Based on selected fields of theory, e.g. ex ante it is presumed that such theories may contribute to the development within the market penetration problematic, and this forms the purpose of this scientific article, i.e. to critically evaluate and compare the basics of such theories, analytic argumentation and fields of application. A meta-theoretical argumentation will apply, as such contributions containing estimated of potential theoretical and methodological flaws - have been surprising limited in numbers. Selected perspectives are not only considered a product of the scientific context, i.e. perspective, within which they were developed, but additionally in relation to the perspective utility value as framework of analysis and terms in this context.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Inden for samfundsvidenskaben ser vi et stigende antal analyser, der trækker på et systemteoretisk iagttagelsesprogram. Problemet er, at disse analyser sjældent gør sig spørgsmålet om dataproduktion klart. Og hvis analyserne anvender interviewmetoden, så udelades refleksioner over interviewet som en særlig erkendelsesstrategi ofte. Artiklen forsøger at udfylde dette tomrum. Først præciseres den videnskabelige iagttagelse med afsæt i den tyske systemteoretiker Niklas Luhmanns iagttagelsesprogram. Dernæst diskuteres den kvalitative interviewmetode mhp. at præcisere, hvilken status interviewet har i systemteoretiske analyser.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Erhvervsrettet forskning i ledelse foregår i vidt omfang i samarbejde med virksomheder, der selv arbejder med forskningens problemstillinger. Det betyder, at der forskes i et felt, der selv reflekterer over de problemstillinger, der undersøges, og som kan bidrage til videnproduktionen på mange andre måder end som 'rå data'. Forskerne kommer med mange forskellige relationer til feltet. Fraen rolle som ren observatør, over rollen som forskende konsulent til egentlig praktiker, der forsker i sit eget miljø. Derfor er det interessant som forsker indenfor dette område at se på metodiske tilgange, der nyttiggør feltets og forskerens egne indsigter i de problemstillinger, der søges belyst, og som direkte kan understøtte aktørernes egen håndtering af disse. Det er interessant ud fra en'traditionel' universitetsbaseret forskningssynsvinkel, og det er interessant i den bredere diskussion af, hvordan virksomhederne styrker deres egen evne til 'forskningsbaseret' refleksion over egenpraksis. Aktionsforsknings traditionen har sit udgangspunkt i forskernes samspil med etreflekterende felt og er derfor en vigtig metodisk inspirationskilde til den erhvervsorienterede forskning. Men aktionsforskningen er ikke konsolideret som én fælles forskningstradition. Der er derimod udviklet en række forskningsmetodiske tilgange såsom: Aktionsforskning, Action science,Sociologisk fantasi, Bruger/borger involvering i udviklingsprojekter, Dialogforskning, Reflectivepractice, Action learning, Appreciative inquiry, Communities of Inquiry in Communities ofpractice, Clinical inquiry (Baskerville 1996). Metoderne er udviklet i relation til det felt eller problemstilling, som forskergrupperne var engagerede i, og kun enkelte er tænkt ind i enerhvervsforskningskontekst. Denne mangfoldighed har ført til, at det enkelte erhvervsforskningsprojekti stort omfang har skullet definere sit eget ståsted for sin interaktion med feltet, opstille sineegne kriterier for etik, kvalitet og generaliserbarhed af resultater og så fremdeles.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper aims at giving a more detailed description and discussion of two concepts of `community' developed in the research areas of text production/ writing and social learning / information management / knowledge sharing and comparing them with each other. The purpose of this theoretical exer-cise is to determine the degree to which the concepts of discourse commu-nity and community of practice are suitable for investigating the social and organizational context of text and knowledge production. Finally, the paper examines the explanatory value of the two concepts for analyzing text and knowledge production at different Danish workplaces (a consulting engi-neering company, a university department and a bank) and discusses their significance in the context of co-located as well as geographically distrib-uted communities.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper aims to address the question whether the dynamic of autoworker unionism in South Korea and Malaysia was conditioned by, and eventually also influenced the globalization processes in the local auto industry? The conclusion is a contextualized "yes", and the core argument is the following: The financial crisis in 1997 was the dramatic peak of financial globalization in East Asia in the 1990s, and it did accelerate the existing trend in Korea towards centralized unionism in the auto industry, while it suspended the trend in the Malaysian auto industry towards decentralized unionism. Although the Korean and Malaysian unions were affected by the financial crisis from different structural and strategic positions, and were exposed to different national policies and corporate strategies of crisis management, the Korean unions and Malaysian unions generally followed, respectively, a more radical and militant and a more pragmatic and moderate strategy. In the global-local perspective we face two paradoxes. The first paradox is that in spite of the difference in union ideology, the outcome in terms of industrial relations (IR) institutions was rather similar in the sense that the auto industry contained a mixture of industrial and enterprise unions and formal or informal federations of these unions, and that collective bargaining was by and large undertaken bilaterally at the enterprise level. This situation was generated by a dynamic, which took the Malaysian system down from a centralized IR system within the low technology assembly industry (the globally subordinated local OEMs) to a rather decentralized IR system within the SOE-MNC controlled industry. The Korean system became more centralized through the confrontations between radical enterprise unions and authoritarian employers and authorities within an auto industry, which over time become much more indigenized, technologically advanced, export-oriented and diversified into multiple auto manufacturers and an under-wood of component suppliers. Yet, in both auto industries the large enterprise unions resisted organizational centralization, which could impede their autonomy. Due to the strength of unions of the market leading firms a breakthrough did happen neither in Korea nor in Malaysia, although the Koreans were a step ahead of the Malaysians having established a federation of metalworkers unions, including the important autoworkers unions. The second paradox is that the radicalism of the Korean autoworker unions was maintained during 1990s globalization of the auto industry, while radicalism was abandoned by the Malaysian autoworker unions in favor of union pragmatism, when the indigenization of the Malaysian auto industry unfolded since the early 1980s and a local auto supplier industry had been formed. This cross-country difference is partly explained by the different position held by the Korean and Malaysian auto companies in the global and local auto value chain. The radicalism and effectiveness of Korean autoworker unions sustained the development of dynamic efficiency among Korean auto manufacturing firms. In the same way, the intra-industry differences in wages and working conditions among auto manufacturing firms and components supplier firms were also related to the stratification of the domestic auto value chain, and this uneven distribution of benefits created obstacles of centralized unionization and collective bargaining. The centralized IR system in Malaysia evolved in an auto industry composed primarily of firms assembling imported CKD kits of components. The inequality of employment conditions between auto manufacturers and component suppliers was a driver of the strategy of centralized unionism and collective bargaining in Korea, while the inequality was not perceived as that significant by the Malaysian industrial union, since they had been dealing with these problems by the early 1990s. Keywords: Globalisation, trade unions, automobile industry, global value chain theory, East Asia, Malaysia, South Korea.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>By drawing on a selective review of literature, we propose that the culture of Danish multinationals and transnational organizations interface with the Chinese and Indian societal and managerial cultures in order to create hybrid cultures in Danish subsidiaries in P. R. China and India. The hybrid culture moderates the relationships between the forms of knowledge and internationalization of multinationals on one hand and the transfer of knowledge on the other. It is postulated that stable cultural frames of the Danes and Chinese managers, both having stable cultural frame, will require long drawn efforts to overcome the cultural distance and transfer the various forms and levels of knowledge in the initial years of the subsidiaries. On the other hand, Indians' style of switching their cultural frames will create less entry problems but more recurring problems once Danish multinationals will get going. Once the postulates are empirically validated, potential implications for strategic interventions are briefly discussed. Keywords: Knowledge transfer, culture, MNCs.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper draws inspiration from Edward Said's orientalism, and examines how the three National Museums of Singapore - the Singapore History Museum, the Singapore Art Museum and the Asian Civilizations Museums - are orientalized. The process is mediated through the museums' close links to tourism promotion in the city-state. The tourism authorities in Singapore have found that the city destination has become too modern and western for many tourists, and the destination has embarked on a campaign to make Singapore more oriental. The creation of the museums is one strategy to orientalize Singapore; these museums assert different layers of Singapore's oriental identities. Each museum appropriates the tourist orientalist imagination in different ways. This paper argues that the orientalist imagination can be understood as a set of knowledge resources for the construction of local identities to enhance a destination's uniqueness and attractiveness. Besides reviewing Said's orientalism, this paper visits criticisms of the theory, within the context of the orientalization process of museums in Singapore.Keywords: orientalism, Singapore Art Museum, Singapore History Museum, Asian Civilizations Museum, Singapore tourism.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>De i denne fremstilling omtalte problemstillinger blev kun ganske kort præsenteret i min oversigtsartikel om "Cost-Benefit Analysens Velfærdsteoretiske Basis" (2005). Det blev deri præciseret, at identifikationsproblemet drejede sig om: Præcis hvilke effekter, der i det hele taget skal medregnes som samfundsøkonomiske fordele og ulemper, hvis analysen skal være fuldstændig og at vurderingsproblemet så drejede sig om spørgsmålet: Hvilke priser, der skal anvendes i forbindelse med værdisætningen af fordele og ulemper. Endvidere blev der givet en summarisk oversigt over en række situationer, hvor man må kunne bruge de aktuelle eller forventede markedspriser, når fordele og ulemper skal værdisættes.I det følgende gives først en mere udførlig redegørelse for nogle af de helt centrale ræsonnementer vedrørende vurderingsproblemet. Sidenhen fører det forholdsvis logisk frem til, at også identifikationsproblemet i en række væsentlige henseender bliver yderligere belyst.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Over the last thirty years, Vietnam evolved from `war after war' to an emerging economy with an attractive foreign investment policy and commitment to a liberalized economy. Although the GDP per capita is still considerably lower than in the Asian Tiger economies, and the institutional framework still reflects inheritances from the central plan system, Vietnam today has a vibrant economy with small businesses springing up at every street corner. Foreign investors have been flogging to Vietnam since the early 1990s, with a new peak of FDI inflow in 2004. This paper reviews the Vietnamese economy, society, culture, and policies towards foreign investment to inform those considering to invest in Vietnam, and to provide some practical advice.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has been maturing as the region prepared to join the European Union (EU). Since the beginning of transition the pattern of FDI has evolved, reflecting new business strategies pursued in anticipation of EU membership. Based on first results from a questionnaire survey conducted in 2003 in Hungary, Lithuania and Poland, we portray the recent patterns and developments in foreign investment, the motives for investment, and managers' assessment of the local business environment. Some questions have been replicated from a study conducted in the emerging economies of Egypt, India, South Africa, and Vietnam, which allows us to benchmark FDI patterns in CEE against other emerging economies in different parts of the world. We find that find fewer changes over the period of the 1990s then we expected, but some interesting differences across the three countries in our study, and between CEE and other emerging economies.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Lately we have seen a growing interest from both public and private organisations to adopt OpenSource Software (OSS), not only for a few, specific applications but also on a more general levelthroughout the organisation. As a consequence, the organisations' decisions on adoption of OSS arebecoming increasingly more important and complex. We present three perspectives organisations canemploy in their decisions: seeing OSS acquisition as a business case, as COTS acquisition, and as architecturalchange within a governance framework. We present case studies of decisions on OSSadoption, and categorise the decision criteria we have found. Our results indicate that for large-scaleadoption of OSS, focus will be on architectural considerations: enterprise-wide architectures will atfirst be a barrier, but in the long term OSS's support of open standards can be a major enabler forOSS adoption. In contrast, in smaller organisations and in small-scale adoption of OSS, the cheapprice of OSS is a major enabler, as it provides a good opportunity for experiments and short-termeconomic benefits. For small organisations these experiments can lead to development of a commonIT-architecture, and in larger organisations OSS can be adopted in niche-areas, without significantlyviolating an existing IT-architecture.Keywords: open source, COTS, IT architecture, governance</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper invites to discuss the processes of individualization and organizing being carried out under what we might see as an emerging regime of change. The underlying argumentation is that in certain processes of change, competence becomes questionable at all times. The hazy characteristics of this regime of change are pursued through a discussion of competencies as opposed to qualifications illustrated by distinct cases from the Danish public sector in the search for repetitive mechanisms. The cases are put into a general perspective by drawing upon experiences from similar change processes in MNCs. The paper concludes by asking whether we can escape from a regime of competence in a world defined by a rhetoric of change and create a more promising world in which doubt and search serve as a strategy for gaining knowledge and professionalism that improve on our capability for mutualism.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>As a social scientist of ethics and morality, Luhmann has noticed the ethical wave that has recently swept across the western world, and states that this particular kind of wave seems to have a wavelength of about one hundred years (cf. Luhmann 1989: 9 ff.). Even though the frequency and the regularity of such a phenomenon is both hard to verify and, if true, difficult to explain, it seems fair to say that since the Enlightenment, an approaching fin-de-siecle has brought an increased interest in matters concerning morality and ethics.1 The present peak has in public-political discourse and some parts of business ethics given prominence to especially one term, namely `value'. The question that interests me is the following: What does the articulation of ethics and morality in terms of values mean for ethics and morality as such. Or, to put the question in a more fashionably way: What is the value of value for morality and ethics?To make things a bit more precise, we can make use of the common distinction between ethics and morality, i.e. that morality is the immediate, collective and unconscious employment of morals, whereas ethics is the systematic, individual and conscious reflections of morals and morality.2 The main question is then, what the use of `value' as the key-term in moral discourses means to morality as such. Accepting ethics as a part of morality - since one cannot be moral without sometimes reflecting on the validity of the morality employed andexperienced - I have attempted to answer this question by investigating what the use of the term `value' leads to in ethical discourses, i.e., what moral implications it has for ethics to focus on the concept of value.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Det er en gennemgående tese i denne undersøgelse af interne evalueringer, at en af de vigtigste kendetegn ved den New Public Management -dominerede udvikling af den offentlige sektors reguleringspolitik, som Danmark såvel som en række andre OECD lande har gennemlevet, er en omfattende brug af alle mulige former for evalueringer og tilsvarende vurderings- og kontrolsystemer til styring og regulering af offentlige institutioner og aktiviteter. Den overordnede samfundsmæssige baggrund for denne udvikling består af en sammenkædning af grundlæggende ændringer i forholdet mellem videnskab og samfund, udvikling af mere og mere komplekse reguleringssystemer og måske vigtigst, hastige ændringer i samfundenes værdigrundlag (individualisering, se Beck 1999) - alt sammenholdt med voksende økonomiske problemer for den offentlige sektor i en globaliseret økonomi.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper argues that the contrast between studies of MNCs which emphasise isomorphism and those which emphasise social embeddedness is unhelpful. Following recent institutionalist discussions which have emphasised the dynamic nature of firms, and institutions, it is argued that the transnational social space of the multinational encompasses a variety of different forms of actors which are engaged in processes that partially produce isomorphism and partially reproduce institutional difference. This perspective is proposed not as a middle way between the two institutionalisms but as a way to capture the ongoing dynamics of MNCs. The paper illustrates this approach through considering four ideal-typical `games' which occur inside MNCs. These games are analysed in terms of the actors, the institutional resources brought into the game, the emerging rules of the game, the outcomes of the game and how these processes relate to institutional theory. These games reveal the complex interaction of processes of isomorphism and social differentiation and suggest an agenda for further research on MNCs that will focus on examining how these games interact and with what effect in different sorts of multinationals. Keywords: Multinationals; institutionalism; varieties of capitalism; isomorphism; embeddedness.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Company performance is increasingly affected by a range of external factors embeddedin a complex network of action controlled by other companies' in its environment. A wellmanaged company, it's argued, is one that is aware of these external factors, and one whoin response seeks to implement tactics maximizing own influence and control over them.Information gathering and model building are tactics normally used in this effort.However, in this article we discuss a third tactic, the tactic of attraction in dyadicrelationships. Founded on the theory of social exchange and based on literature reviewson long-term-orientation in relationships and relationship value we develop a conceptualmodel highlighting the components of attraction in business to business relationships.First we demonstrate how the force of attraction can be understood as partners expectedrelationship value and how expected relationship value in turn is strengthened orweakened by partner- comfortability and dependability. Then we show how partnersperceived attraction towards an industrial company can be managed using a combinationof structural- and behavioral adjustments.Key words: Inter-organizational relationships; Relationship Management; Relationship-value;Attraction.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This inaugural address is a welcome opportunity to call your attention to a new area of research that the International Center for Business and Politics has chosen as one of five areas of special interest. By referring to this area of focus as'institutional competition in the media market' we also signal an approach that will be free of much of the traditional dogma in Danish media research: First of all, we will consider the media as a market for opinion, goods and services - not primarily as a cultural discourse with a singular focus on public service. Secondly, we consider media activity from a social science / leadership perspective - not from the perspective of a journalist or from the ideologically critical perspective of the license payer. Thirdly, we consider competition in the media market as an institutional phenomenon that is not solely conditioned by economic considerations. We aim to find a third way between economic determinism and the optimism of political regulation. The media enterprise as institutionalized practice is, from our perspective, placed at the intersection of the marketplace and politics. We recognize that the daily press, radio and television in Denmark have emerged from a tradition based upon ideals of freedom of expression, democracy and the enlightenment of the general public. At the same time we stress the fact that the media worldwide is Big Business - and that this reality has an increasing effect on Danish competitiveness and business development in general. Not only as a channel for opinion, but as a political actor and a potential business locomotive in the so-called culture- and experience-economy.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The article analyses how government spending is determined under differentexchange rate regimes in the context of a small open economy. Assumingnominal wage contracts which last for one period and assuming a benevolentgovernment which determines government spending to optimise a representativeindividual's utility, it is demonstrated that there are differences betweenexchange rate regimes with respect to the level of government spending. Thesedifferences arise first because a rise in government spending affects macroeconomicvariables differently under different exchange rate regimes, and secondbecause the government's inclination to expand government spending is affectedby inflation which depends on the exchange rate regime. At low rates of inflation,the government is inclined to set a higher level of government spending under afixed exchange rate regime than under a floating exchange rate regime in whichthe monetary authority optimises preferences which include an employment targetand an inflation target. As government spending affects the representativeindividual's utility, the choice of exchange rate regime has an impact on welfare.Keywords: exchange rate regimes; fiscal policy; monetary union; inflationtargeting.JEL classicification: E42, E61, E62, F33.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The article is an empirical analysis of how a Scandinavian new economy firm was able to persuade a number of business journalists that it represented `the future'. It analyses how visitors to the firm were met with a specific and persuasive combination of rhetorical and material ressources. It suggests that the persuasive power of the firm was based on its ability to evoke and articulate a series of pointed contrasts between the attractive working life within the firm and the ordinary and problematic work life elsewhere. The article suggests that this strategy of drawing contrasts together differs from the mode of persuasion usually described by STS. Keywords: Sociology of expectations, Sociology of futures, Sociology of anticipation, New Economy, dot-com, persuasion, power, actor-network theory, materialised contrast argument.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Multinationals are faced with the problem of how to coordinate different actors and stop `fiefdoms' emerging that inhibits the achievement of transnational cooperation? We identify this as a problem of `constitutional ordering' in the firm. Drawing on Varieties of Capitalism approaches, we explore how multinationals from different contexts seek to create constitutional orders. We argue that the models which exist appear to be destructive of coordination. We explore the implications for MNCs.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Manglen på en fælles europæisk offentlighed er et af de karakteristika, der oftest nævnes sombegrænsende omstændighed for den europæiske integration. Uden et fælles offentligt rum,hvor synspunkter kan udveksles og en offentlig mening samt en bredere fornemmelse af fællesskab af kollektiv europæisk identitet kan opstå, kan den Europæiske Union (EU) ikke styrke sin demokratiske legitimitet, og unionen må derfor fortsætte med at legitimere sig gennem de nationale demokratier, lyder argumentet. I de senere år har den europæiske udvikling imidlertid i stigendegrad bevæget sig fra mellemstatsligt til overstatsligt samarbejde, og i den anledning er en rækkeinitiativer, der dels søger at sikre det formelle, legale grundlag for et sådant overstatsligtsamarbejde, dels søger at involvere medlemslandenes befolkninger mere aktivt og direkte, blevetiværksat. Disse initiativer kan samles under betegnelsen debatten om Europas fremtid, der i denneafhandling står for totaliteten af nationale og overnationale meningsdannelsesprocesser rettet modreformeringen af EU's eksisterende traktatmæssige grundlag. Den igangværende reformproces kansiges for alvor at have taget form og retning i løbet af 2000 og at have nået et foreløbigt klimaksmed stats- og regeringsledernes vedtagelse af en europæisk forfatningstraktat i juni 2004. Processenvil finde sin endelige afslutning, når traktaten enten er blevet ratificeret i alle medlemslandene, hvadenten denne godkendelse sker glat eller traktaten forkastes i et eller flere lande og må igennemyderligere bearbejdning, eller den er blevet forkastet, fordi det har vist sig umuligt at opnå allemedlemslandenes tilslutning til den.Denne afhandling fokuserer på debatten om Europas fremtids tidligste stadier fradebatten blev lanceret og officielt anerkendt som en ny reformrunde i 2000 til den i december 2001blev institutionaliseret med beslutningen om at nedsætte det såkaldte europæiske konvent.Afhandlingen analyserer udvalgte tekster, der dels dækker den udvalgte periode, dels repræsentererforskellige nationale og overnationale dimensioner af debatten. Det overnationale aspekt udtrykkesprimært i to erklæringer udstedt af det europæiske råd, det vil sige alle EU's medlemslandes statsogregeringschefer i enhed; en tale holdt af præsidenten for den europæiske kommission, Romano Prodi, udgør en yderligere overnational dimension. Fem nationale kontekster - Danmark, England, Frankrig, Spanien og Tyskland - inddrages, og disse kontekster studeres dels gennem taler afholdtaf ledende politikere, dels gennem den nationale pressedækning af de i alt seks taler og de to erklæringer. Undersøgelsen foregår således at taler og erklæringer opfattes som initiativer på pressedækningen responderer, og det overordnede formål er at udfinde blivende nationale særprægog fremkommende europæiske ligheder.Projektets grundlæggende perspektiv er retorisk: meningsdannelse af en hver slags det være sig politisk mening som den, der studeres, og akademisk mening som den, der søges produceret opfattes som en retorisk proces. Det vil sige at meningsdannelse er en kommunikativhandling, der både muliggøres og begrænses af den kontekst hvori den indgår. Mening opstår i etgensidigt konstituerende samspil mellem den overordnede helhed og den konkrete artikulation,mellem de forventninger kommunikationen er underlagt og den kreativitet kommunikatøren læggerfor dagen. Meningsdannelsen i det udvalgte tekstlige materiale erklæringer, taler, avisartikler -analyseres ud fra denne grundlæggende opfattelse, og der benyttes konkrete retoriskeanalyseredskaber. Afhandlingen har dog også et vigtigt tværfagligt element: samfundsvidenskabelige teoridannelser om legitimitet, identitet og offentlig mening informererbåde forståelsen af den europæiske integrationsproces som sådan og analysen af den aktuelleeuropæiske debat. Spørgsmålet er dels hvordan legitimitet, identitet og offentlig mening benyttes idebatten, altså hvordan allerede fastsatte betydninger af begreberne inddrages i den tekstuellemeningsdannelse, dels hvordan legitimering, identifikation og o</dc:description>

					<dc:description>For the study of economic integration, it is costumary to use a three countryworld,where two of the countries may introduce forms of closer economic cooperation. Inthe present model, we follow this tradition but put special emphasis on the role ofcredit and entrepreneurship. Our model is of the standard neoclassical type, with theaddition that production takes time and is subject to uncertainty. Also, firms must usethe financial system in order to buy inputs; the cost of credit may differ among countriesand industries, reflecting their basic patterns of uncertainty.Following the Newbery-Stiglitz approach, we show that in such model we mayexhibit cases of Pareto inferior trade and, in particular, Pareto inferior economicintegration. More specifically, we show that integrating countries of very differenteconomic size may give rise to adverse effects on welfare, whereas integration ofcountries with a more similar economic structure and size tends to have beneficialeffects for the parties.Keywords: trade, uncertainty, Pareto inferior trade, regional integration.JEL classification: F11, F15, F34</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Several writers link entrepreneurship to asset ownership, trying to incorporatethe theory of entrepreneurship into the theory of the firm. The critical link, weargue, is capital heterogeneity. Transaction cost, property rights, and resourcebasedapproaches to the firm assume that assets, both tangible and intangible,are heterogeneous; arranging these assets to minimize contractual hazards, toprovide efficient investment incentives, or to exploit competitive advantage isconceived as the prime task of economic organization. None of these approaches,however, is based on a systematic theory of capital heterogeneity. Inthis paper we outline the approach to capital developed by the Austrian schoolof economics and integrate it into an entrepreneurial theory of the firm. We refineAustrian capital theory by defining capital heterogeneity in terms of subjectivelyperceived attributes, that is, the functions, characteristics, and uses ofcapital assets. Such attributes are not given, but have to be discovered by meansof entrepreneurial action. Thinking of entrepreneurship as the organization ofheterogeneous capital provides new insights into the emergence, boundaries,and internal organization of the firm, and it suggests testable implications abouthow and where entrepreneurship is manifested.Keywords: Entrepreneurship, heterogeneous assets, judgment, ownership, firmboundaries, internal organization.JEL Codes: B53, D23, L2</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper explores reasons for negative complementarity among HRM practices. It isbuilt upon the premise that there are certain HRM practices influencing extrinsic andintrinsic motivation of knowledge receivers. If those HRM practices are applied in acomplementary way, their impact on knowledge-related outcomes will result incrowding effect of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and be negative. Hypothesesderived from these arguments are tested on the data from 92 subsidiaries of Danishmultinational corporations located in 11 countries.Extrinsic/intrinsic motivation, HRM practices, knowledge transfer</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Studies of the sources of innovations have recognized that many innovations are developedby users. However, the fact that firms employ communities of users to strengthen their innovationprocess has not yet received much attention. In firm-established user communities users freely revealinnovations to a firm's product platform, which in turn puts the firm in a favorable position (a) becausethese new product features become available to all users by sharing on a user-to-user basis, or (b)because it allows the firm to pick up the innovations and integrate them in future products and thenbenefit by selling them to all users. We study the key personal attributes of the individuals responsiblefor innovations and the creation of value in this organizational context, namely the innovative users, toexplain why firm-established user communities work. Analyzing data derived from a web-basedquestionnaire generating 442 answers we find that innovative users are likely to be (i) hobbyists, anattribute that can be assumed to affect innovators' willingness to share innovations (positively), and (ii)responsive to `firm-recognition' as a motivating factor for undertaking innovation, which explainstheir decision to join the firm's domain. In agreement with earlier studies we also find that innovativeusers are likely to be `lead users', an attribute that we assume to affect the quality of user innovation.Whether or not a firm-established user community can be turned into an asset for the firm is to a greatextent conditioned by the issues studied in this paper.Keywords: Innovation, User community, User CharacteristicsJEL code(s): L21; L23; O31; O32</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The strategies firms use to protect their intellectual property and knowledgecan strongly influence their ability to capture the benefits of their innovative efforts.In attempting to appropriate their innovations, firms can chose from a range ofmechanisms, including patents, trade secrets and lead times. Yet, little is known abouthow the use of different appropriability mechanisms may shape innovativeperformance. Using a large-scale database of UK manufacturing firms, we examinehow legal (such as patents) and first mover (such as secrecy) appropriability strategiesshape performance. We find that both strategies are curvilinearly (taking an invertedU-shape) related to innovative performance, indicting that some firms may sufferfrom a myopia of protectiveness, relying too heavily on appropriation to the detrimentof other activities.Keywords: Appropriability, Intellectual property rights, Innovation, Innovativeperformance</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Though they developed in isolation, the theory of entrepreneurship andthe economic theory of the firm can be usefully integrated. In particular, the conceptof entrepreneurship as judgment associated with Knight (1921) and some Austrianschool economists aligns naturally with the theory of the firm. Because judgmentcannot be purchased on the market, the entrepreneur needs a firm &amp;mdash; a set of alienableassets he controls &amp;mdash; to carry out his function. We show how this notion of judgmentilluminates key themes in the modern theory of the firm (existence, boundaries,and internal organization). In our approach, resource uses are not data, but are createdas entrepreneurs envision new ways of using assets to produce final goods. Theentrepreneur's problem is aggravated by the fact that capital assets are heterogeneous.Asset ownership allows the entrepreneur to experiment with novel combinationsof heterogeneous assets. The boundaries of the firm, as well as aspects of internalorganization, may also be understood as responses to entrepreneurial processesof experimentation.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Delineation of the relevant market forms a pivotal part of most antitrustcases. The standard approach is sequential. First the product marketis delineated, then the geographical market is defined. Demand andsupply substitution in both the product dimension and the geographicaldimension will normally be stronger than substitution in either dimension.By ignoring this one might decide first to define products narrowly andthen to define the geographical extent narrowly ignoring the possibility ofa diagonal substitution. These reflections are important in the empiricaldelineation of product and geographical markets. Using a unique data setfor prices of Norwegian and Scottish salmon, we propose a methodologyfor simultaneous market delineation and we demonstrate that comparedto a sequential approach conclusions will be reversed.JEL: C3, K21, L41, Q22Keywords: Relevant market, econometric delineation, salmon.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In this paper, we present the results of a pilot study in Denmark of cross cultural effects on Think Aloud usability testing. We provide an overview of previous research on cross cultural usability evaluation with a special focus on the relationship between the evaluator and the test user. This relation was studied in an experiment with usability testing of a localized clipart application in which eight participants from Denmark and India formed pairs of evaluator-test user. The test users were asked to think aloud and the evaluators' role were to facilitate the test users thinking aloud and hereby identify usability problems with the clipart application. Data on the evaluators' and test users' behaviour were recorded and analyzed by coding and summarizing statistics on these behavioural events. The results show that Think Aloud Usability Test of a localized application is most effectively performed, in terms of number of think aloud events and number of usability problems found, when both the evaluators and the test users are local. These results are however limited to the Danish context and need to be investigated in other cultural settings.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Our paper reports research from the emerging institutional field of venture capitalists in Europe. In Europe venture capitalism began to emerge about ten years ago, and thus, in Europe the phenomenon has the characteristics of emergence and novelty, as a local in-dustry venture capitalists have yet to develop distinctive characteristics. The European countries do not constitute a homogeneous institutional environment, but must be per-ceived as different local settings, and thus, venture capitalism may evolve into different forms in the various parts of Europe. The objective is to understand if and how differen-ces in local institutional settings affect learning and adaptation by European venture ca-pitalists and start-ups, and thus, affect the processes of field formation. For example, it has been observed that institutional settings can facilitate or discourage learning from direct experience (Herriot et al., 1985). Thus, depending on the institutional settings venture capitalists and start-ups may rely on diffusion of experience in various degrees. Experiences can diffuse from the US, where venture capitalism as an entrepreneurial form evolved in Silicon Valley in the 1970s. In the US venture capitalists represent an institutionalized type of organization with formalized rules and standards, codified be-havior and roles (Suchman, 1995; Suchman et al., 2001). European venture capitalists and start-ups may imitate behavior and rules developed in Silicon Valley, and thus, a second research objective is to understand if and how US venture capitalism affect the evolvement of venture capitalism in Europe. We study the emergence of a venture capitalist industry in Denmark and Italy, and thus, by selecting two countries with distinctive differences in cultures and institutions, we study learning and adaptation by venture capitalists and start-ups in different institutio-nal settings. We suggest that venture capitalists and start-ups perceiving institutional settings as non venture-friendly are more likely to rely on learning by imitation than on trial-and-error learning.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Hvordan kan man forklare, at små, nystartede, ressourcesvage virksomheder er i stand til at udfordre og sommetider udkonkurrere store, markedsledende foretagender - ofte med utroligt enkle virkemidler? Som er i stand til at ændre spillets regler på trods af intens konkurrence og høje adgangsbarrierer.Praksis viser, at teknologiske opdagelser, produktmæssig nyskabelse, speciel heldig timing eller særlig passivitet fra konkurrenters side langtfra altid er forklaring nok. Der må med andre ord eksistere en unik innovationsform eller -formel, der kan føre til konkurrencefordele ad helt andre veje! Dette paper præsenterer og diskuterer en sådan anden opfattelse af innovation og viden med fokus på den virksomhed eller iværksætter, som ikke har andet at ty til end idérigdom. Som er nødt til at bryde med spillets regler og betræde helt nye stier for at kunne konkurrere. Det har jeg kaldt strategisk innovation.Konklusionen er, at strategisk innovation frembringes af særlige kompetencer. Kompetencer, som den lille,ressourcemæssigt underlegne virksomhed eller outsiderenhar mindst lige så store chancer for at beherske sometablerede spillere i markedet. Nøglen til strategisk innovationer kreativ markedsviden omsat til ny, overraskendeforretningslogik!</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the recent debate in the political science literature on analytical approaches to learning, which has gradually developed in a direction of being less and less individualistic. Section 3 follows up on this development and introduces a social constructivist approach to learning that redefines learning as changes in language-constituted relations to others. In section 4 this argument is elaborated into a model for mutual learning. Section 5 contains a qualitative analysis of the organisation of the EES in practice with regard to the possibilities of policy diffusion of the EES learning processes as predicted in the model in section 4. Section 6 deals with the conflictual views on the size and character of the learning processes of the EES in recent studies and proposes a new methodological path to investigate the mutual learning processes based upon a social constructivist approach. Section 7 is the conclusion of the article which sums up the examination of the both the various approaches to learning analysed in the paper and the evaluation of the possibilities of policy diffusion resulting from the learning processes.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Jeg har valgt at benytte denne anledning til at introducere et nyt forskningsfelt, som CBS International Center for Business and Politics har prioriteret som et af sine fem indsatsområder. Vi kalder det 'institutionel konkurrence på mediemarkedet' og signalerer derved nogle frontale opgør med traditionelle dogmer i dansk medieforskning: For det første ser vi medierne som et marked for meninger, varer og tjenesteydelser - ikke primært som en kulturel offentlighed med ensidig fokus på public service. For det andet betragter vi medievirksomhed i et samfundsvidenskabeligt ledelsesperspektiv - ikke primært i et journalistisk medarbejderperspektiv eller et ideologikritisk licensbetalerperspektiv.For det tredje betragter vi konkurrencen på mediemarkedet som et institutionelt fænomen - ikke alene som noget driftsøkonomisk betinget. Vi forsøger kort sagt at finde en tredje vej mellem økonomisk determinisme og politisk reguleringsoptimisme. Derved placeres medievirksomhed som en institutionaliseret praksis i skæringspunktet mellem marked og politik. Vi anerkender, at dagspresse, radio og tv i Danmark er vokset ud af en publicistisk tradition med vægt på idealer om ytringsfrihed, demokrati og folkeoplysning. Men vi understreger samtidig, at medievirksomheden world-wide er big business - og at det får stadig større betydning for dansk konkurrenceevne og erhvervsudvikling mere alment. Ikke kun som kanal for andres meninger, men som en politisk aktør og et potentielt erhvervslokomotiv i den såkaldte oplevelsesøkonomi.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>There is currently a paucity of literature focusing on the relationship between theactions of staff members, who perpetrate some form of computer abuse, and theorganisational environment in which such actions take place. A greater understandingof such a relationship may complement existing security practices by possiblyhighlighting new areas for safeguard implementation. To help facilitate a greaterunderstanding of the offender/environment dynamic, this paper assesses the feasibilityof applying criminological theory to the IS security context. More specifically, threetheories are advanced, which focus on the offender's behaviour in a criminal setting. Drawing on an account of the Barings Bank collapse, events highlighted in the casestudy are used to assess whether concepts central to the theories are supported by thedata. It is noted that while one of the theories is to be found wanting in terms ofconceptual sophistication, the case can be made for the further exploration of applyingall three in the IS security context.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Modern global society has seen dramatic changes that throw us into impenetrable ethical problems of a kind never before witnessed in history. By this means, ethical problems constitute the locus of our confrontation with our own life situation. It is this condition that I take to be of fundamental importance when one undertakes to reflect upon the meaning of ethics today. If we approach the issue from the point of view of the history of ideas, we find that throughout the whole of the history of philosophy there have been a series of different attempts to articulate an ethics. Most of them address our concerns about how a human being ought to act in order to realise his or her life in the best or most correct way. I will return to the array of suggestions that have been offered in this regard. What is important for my purposes, meanwhile, is that there is some-thing that precedes ethical considerations, namely, the fact that ethics imposes itself upon the indi-vidual as a vital problem, and as one that cannot be escaped.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to address two normative and interlinked methodological and theoretical questions concerning the Open Method of Coordination (OMC): First, what is the most appropriate approach to learning in the analyses of the processes of the European Employment Strategy (EES)? Second, how should mutual learning processes be diffused among the Member States in order to be efficient? In answering these two questions the paper draws on a social constructivist approach to learning thereby contributing to the debate about learning in the political science literature. At the same time, based on the literature and participatory observations, it is concluded that the learning effects of the EES are probably somewhat larger than what is normally suggested, but that successful diffusion still depends on a variety of contextual factors. At the end of the paper a path for empirical research based upon a social constructivist approach to learning is suggested.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper defines a base model of the airborne passenger traffic to and in Greenland showing the number of passengers on every non-stop connection. The type of airplane is defined for each route, and that determines the flying time. The number of connections and capacity utilization are fixed with due regard to the timetable of Air Greenland and the density of traffic on each route. Assumptions as to the cost per hour as a function of the duration of the flight are made for each aircraft. Applying this to different investment scenarios for airports and landing strips an index for the costs of supply of air traffic is found. Using this index the supplier's cost savings in the scenarios are found as a percentage of the relevant sale. A number of reports from recent years have information about the necessary investments in the scenarios, and matching these with the changes in costs permits the calculation of present values for the different projects. Apart from direct savings there are derived benefits in some of the scenarios the most prominent being the possibility to abandon Kangerlussuaq. The calculations include these indirect effects. Two scenarios have high present values: the use of Keflavik as hub, and the construction of a new airport with a 3000 meter runway south of Nuuk: two rather different scenarios, the first dominated by current savings, and the second dependent on a large fixed investment.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The purpose of this paper is to develop a reputation model for higher education programmes, provide empirical evidence for the model and illustrate its application by using Copenhagen Business School (CBS) as the recurrent case. The developed model is a cause-and-effect model linking image to reputation via rational and emotional evaluations as well as relevant corporate identity determinants. As reputation, image and identity are very complex concepts, it is important to determine which of the many elements should be included in the model. This paper discusses why a given aspect is important for higher education reputation and which relations exist between the included determinants from a theoretical perspective. It is demonstrated how the model and measurement system may be a useful management tool for the improvement of the reputation of a higher education. In this way, the model can help leaders of higher education institutions to set strategic directions and support their decisions in an effort to create even better study programmes with a better reputation. Finally, managerial implications and directions for future research are discussed.Keywords: Reputation, image, corporate identity, higher education, structural equation modelling.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In his influential essay on markets, An essay on framing and overflowing (1998), Michel Callon writes that `the growing complexity of industrialized societies [is] due in large part to the movements of the technosciences, which are causing connections and interdependencies to proliferate'. This paper is about tech-noscience, and about the proliferation of connections and interdependencies created by it.More specifically, the paper is about stem cells. Biotechnology in general has the power to capture the imagination. Within the field of biotechnology nothing seems more provocative and tantalizing than stem cells, in research, in medicine, or as products.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Modding - the modification of existing products by consumers - is increasingly exploited by manufacturers to enhance product development and sales. In the computer games industry modding has evolved into a development model in which users act as unpaid `complementors' to manufacturers' product platforms. This article explains how manufacturers can profit from their abilities to organize and facilitate a process of innovation by user communities and capture the value of the innovations produced in such communities. When managed strategically, two distinct, but not mutually exclusive business models appear from the production of user complements: firstly, a manufacturer can let the (free) user complements `drift' in the user communities, where they increase the value to consumers of owning the given platform and thus can be expected to generate increased platform sales, and secondly, a manufacturer can incorporate and commercialize the best complements found in the user communities. Keywords: innovation, modding, user communities, software platform, business model. JEL code(s): L21; L23; O31; O32</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The project on Personalisation of Self-service Solutions across On-line Platforms (POSS ON-LINE) focuses on users, clients, and self-service solutions. It is based on the understanding that clients and users are different and have different goals, and that self-service takes place in different contexts, on different platforms, and within different applications and this requires development of complementary approaches and solutions. Traditionally the tools used to predict user behaviour build on users leaving traces of their actions. However, new application and developments for existing applications do not gather traces, and new ways of profiling the user is needed. To digitalise e.g. public services such as TOLD &amp; SKAT to meet citizen's needs is a huge challenge because the user's context has to be taken into account. As the tracking tools are not sufficiently refined (1,4,14) pushing of information to users with the aim of increasing sales, e.g. AMAZON, still leaves much to be wished for. Despite the fact that the user profile, which the system generates, is continuously updated through user's interaction with the system (15), e.g. myyahoo.com. Personalised application may both service the client and the user. The system gathers data about the user, which enables the client to push information to the user. Personalisation enables graphic user interface design that is personalised and relevant to the individual user and invites the user to get access to information with less strain. Personalisation of self-service solutions is promising and IT companies are experiencing an increase in the clients' demands. At the same time the development of solutions moves within a shorter and shorter time span. Hence the process of innovations is paced and there is an increasing need of new ways of looking at the process of development. However, we lack methods to predict user behaviour without having to deal with huge amounts of data and data from both quantitative data as well as life world observations are required.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Jeg vil i denne sammenhæng præsentere en fortolkning af hvordan Jürgen Habermas i forhold til klassisk epistemologi forstår viden og læring. Jeg vil argumentere for at vi i videnssamfundet har brug for den realistiske diskursbaserede model for videnstestning og vidensdannelse Habermas repræsenterer. Endvidere vil jeg ved at rekonstruere Habermas' position med overbevisningen og propositionen som omdrejningspunkt vise at Habermas teori direkte kan omsættes som analysegrundlag og forståelsesramme for en hvilken som helst tematiseret praksis. Alt hvad der er virkeligt kan udtrykkes propositionelt. Den kritiske teoris metode handler grundlæggende om at finde en interessant proposition og herefter finde argumenter for og imod dens gyldighed.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Det kommunale landkort gennemløber netop i denne tid en markant forandring. Strukturreformen initierer en omvæltning af den offentlige sektor ikke set siden kommunalreformen i 1970'erne. Nye tider er på vej. Nye grænser trækkes - være det sig geografiske, opgaverelaterede, stillingskategoriske, organisatoriske- og styringsmæssige. Dette working-paper er et bidrag i diskussionen om strukturreformen og den generelle moderniseringsproces i den offentlige sektor. Det griber fat i en kommunal enhed, der allerede har gennemløbet en del af de omvæltninger, som landets øvrige kommuner pt. står overfor, nemlig Bornholms regionskommune. I paperet foretages en uvildig undersøgelse af regionskommunens nye styreform og administrative organisering, der er igangsat i kølvandet på kommunensammenlægningen i 2003. Working-paperet er desuden publiceret som en rapport i BUPL-regi (Januar 2005). Rapporten/working-paperet er således skabt på initiativ af BUPL (Forbundet for pædagoger og klubfolk), særligt BUPL-Bornholm. En tak skal derfor lyde til BUPL (Lars Feldt, Ulla Kjærgaard og Leif Kjærgaard) for finansiering af projektet og for information omkring aktuelle problematikker og udfordringer i og omkring Bornholms regionskommune. Vi takker desuden de interviewede fra regionskommunen for at have givet os en indsigt i facts, problemskitseringer og scenarieopstillinger - og på den måde bidraget til at give analysen kraft. Forud for rapporten er foretaget et pilotprojekt, der fungerer som inspirationskilde og vidensgrundlag for nærværende rapport/working-paper. Der skal derfor lyde en stor tak til de deltagende studerende for et grundigt analytisk og indsigtsfuldt arbejde.Rapporten/working-paperet henvender sig til såvel praktikere i og omkring Bornholms regionskommune, som forskere, konsulenter, studerende og øvrige interesserede i organisations- og strukturforandringer samt styrings- og ledelsesmæssige problematikker i en kommunal sammenhæng.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In this article I will interpret John Deweys perspective on reflective thinking as if he were a philosopher of innovation management. From his pragmatist point of departure, the problems involved in knowledge-processes relevant to innovation are analysed and reconceptualised. On the basis of the analysis I attempt to identify some categories of general applicability when understanding, designing, and managing radical innovation processes. These categories are useful to conceptualise and talk about innovation, when knowledge is taken seriously, and when managing innovation is also understood as managing the production of new knowledge, that is of making the unjustified justified, and the unknown known. Keywords: Reflexivity, reflective thought, radical innovation, innovation management, potential innovation, Plato, John Dewey, epistemology, knowledge.</dc:description>

					<dc:title>Trust and Leadership : On the Value Laden Concept of Trust</dc:title>

					<dc:description>The concept and phenomenon of trust and its relation to leadership has recently come into focus. What role does trust play? Can trust be created strategically? Questions like these are often raised. How we conceive of and conceptualize trust is not as often discussed. Among those conceptualizations of trust available are those understanding trust as normatively value laden and those attempting to understand trust as normatively neutral. In this article I will attempt to challenge the idea that trust as a concept and phenomenon meaningfully can be understood as symmetrical and normatively neutral. One need not continue the phrase `trust is good,' with `control is better,' as e.g., Stalin did. Let us stop with `trust is good,' and look at the implications of this evaluation. It is my conviction that trust is normally something which is normatively desirable, and that trust is a concept which cannot be exempted from a discussion of value judgment. This is perhaps because trust as a phenomenon is good in itself, even before it becomes good for something else. This point of view has consequences for understanding trust as connected to a systematic form of observation which is more or less directly claimed to be normatively neutral.i Such a view on analyzing trust presupposes that trust and mistrust are symmetrical and not so different. Such a point of view makes it possible for the terminology to maintain its normative neutrality (Luhmann 1979). Understanding trust by defining it as a conception characterized by normative neutrality is in thesystem theoretical universe interconnected with the fundamental premise that functionality and functional self-stabilization are more important than validity.The assumption of neutrality is also interconnected with the idea that functionality is normatively neutral and is not in itself attributed value judgments. Mistrust becomes, in principle, as equally good a form of observation as trust - or more explicitly stated, the question of good becomes irrelevant in the systems theoretical universe - all that is relevant is that both observations claim to be able to reduce complexity. It is this viewpoint on value related neutrality and concept related symmetry I wish to subject to a critical evaluation. At the same time I am interested in showing that one can in fact say something about trust and trust production by exposing some of the conditions which lay at the foundation for declaring trust or mistrust. My argument against the understanding of trust as value neutral is divided into five sections wherein I address different aspects of trust as a concept and phenomenon. In the first section, I address the trust concept's connection with other related concepts, and show the inherent attribution of value within the concept. In the following section, I show the complexity which arises in and with that trust both can be a precondition for and a product of social processes. The creation of trust can be both the intentionally intended and functionally unintended; for example, trust can be something that is desirable, but can arise without anyone having planned it. In the third section, I argue that there is a difference between having trust in a phenomenon and having trust in one's knowledge of the same phenomenon. The fourth section addresses the question in relation to the trust phenomena's strategic flexibility of form for example, the idea that one with leadership tools can consciously bring forth trust. In the conclusion, the question about trust communication is addressed. In this section I argue that trust is positively value-laden, becausesincerity is a functional and pragmatic condition for successful communication which is oriented towards understanding.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Constructivism is one of the most successful paradigms within the social and human sciences at the beginning of the new millennium. But it is a very disputed paradigm, and critical accounts of this domi-nating -ism are proliferating. Recently, the critics have become more visible, and the paradigm is now challenged seriously. Being critics of constructivism ourselves we welcome this tendency. How-ever, we are also critical of the critique since it tends to dichotomise the debate to an unnecessary degree, and, at times, does not admit the very fertile insights that are also part of the constructivist ap-proach. In the following we shall join the critique, but in doing so we will point towards a moderated view of the ways in which the world becomes meaningful to us. Our aim is to sketch out a theoretical perspective that benefits from both the insights of constructivism and its critics, and thereby is able to realise the full explanatory potential of both.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper analyses management of product innovation in project-based industries, offering a view on management not only of firms, but also of markets. It first argues that projects are prominent in industries where the nature of consumer demand means that product innovation takes place as experimentation. Then, the paper argues that if skills needed for projects are very diverse and projects are complex, there are few internal managerial economies of projects, and the scope for management then transcends the boundaries of firms. In these cases, markets become organized in combinations of people, contracts, and other institutions, in order to facilitate the coordination of market-based projects. While contracts play a role, a continuous, active role of knowledgeable managers (leaders and boundary spanners) is also often necessary. Such managers --- and thus (core parts of) whole industries --- are embedded in project ecologies at particular places, which is why we see geographical clusters in many project-based industries. The paper is mainly conceptual, but develops its argument by drawing examples from the Entertainment industries throughout.

					<dc:description>In contemporary society, it is believed that things are changing at an increasingly rapid pace. We see this in newspapers, books, or every speech we listen to that modern (business) life is a race towards new horizons, or towards newness tout court. No matter which standpoint one engages vis-à-vis the rhetoric of change and the accompanying need to innovate and be creative, it is important to reflect upon the way one presents oneself vis-à-vis important stakeholders, including the most invested stakeholder - oneself. It is also within the strong rhetoric of change, that we witness an often-mentioned observation that economic transformation and globalization continue to alter how organizations and employees view work, and that these transformations require that workers and managers understand and adjust to major changes in definitions of and approaches to work, organizational structures, and relationships within and among organizations. Social scientists like Caves (2000) and Florida (2002) argue that creativity, as a resource, is critical for long-term economic development and that creative industries, in particular, act as agents of change that help drive economic development. In fact, creative industries are experiencing rapid growth, both in Denmark (Kultur- og Erhvervspolitisk Redegørelse, 2000; Regeringen, September, 2003) and globally (Pine and Gilmore, 1999), and it is generally believed that there are important lessons to be learnt from the `cultural, creative motor'. Yet, they are little understood. Caves (2000) notes that, `economists have studied a number of industrial sectors for their special and distinctive features', but have largely missed `the creative industries supplying goods and services that we broadly associate with cultural, artistic, or simply entertainment value' (Caves, 2000:1).2 What researchers of creative industries have yet to examine, is not only how organizations within the creative industries operate and how the organizational members define and manage work, but also how the very meaning of being a creative company is performed, for example in a process of narrative identity construction. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify and understand the narrativeforms and processes through which creative enterprises organize and manage their symbolic communication and, in the process, attempt to balance creative-artistic and commercial interests. In this paper, we shall focus upon Zentropa, a filmmaking company that has generally been accredited with the etiquette of `creative agent of change' vis-à-vis the Danish film industry. Thus, Zentropa is recognized as a creative player that has made a difference and it is to this narrative of Zentropa as a creative company that we direct our attention. More specifically, we propose that it matters what narrative is told about a company, and how a specific narrative is enacted, changed, and challenged during the course of a specific development. For a company like Zentropa, for whom the modern mantra `there is more identity in deviation than in conformity' (see e.g. Bauman, 2000; Giddens, 1991; Sennett, 1998), it seems vital to represent and identify themselves as anti-establishment and a rebel with a cause in its way of being a film company in the Danish film field. The very concern with deviation, with being different, seems to force Zentropa to engage in ongoing reflections as to their own narrative identity. In a more general vein, we contend that there is a great need to come to a better understanding of the dynamics of identity (as also pointed out by Albert et al., 2000:14) in a society that appears restless in its infatuated praise of speed, innovation, and change. These are values with consequences for the way we make sense of ourselves and relate to others. Moreover, these are values that seem embodied by the exemplary case chosen in this project, namely Zentropa, an organization that seems almost exhibitionistic in its constant involvement in dialogues in the public space. Thus, Zentropa seems an exemplary case to study the</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The article analyses the multinational oil-company Shell's decision in 1997 to establish Shell International Renewables. Theoretically the analysis contributes to developing the garbage can decision-making model developed originally by Cohen, March and Olsen (1972) by adding the production of organisational identities to the model. Within the scientific field of business and the environment the article contributes to a new understanding of the relationship between decision-making, green organisational identities and the process of social construction of business opportunities. This relationship can be of a sort, where the corporations' greener organisational identities are the product of random organisational garbage can decision-making processes. In such processes the rationale that the protection of the natural environment can be viewed as a business opportunity gets into focus not before, but after the decision has happened. Thus, in the process of accounting for their decision the corporations are not just accounting for a particular decision, but also in a general sense contributing to socially constructing anew what can be considered a business opportunity - also for other corporations. In this process of socially constructing new business opportunities the corporations are drawing on cultural sources not just from the field of rhetoric of economics, but also from other cultural sources within the business sector and the society as such.</dc:description>

Når ingeniøren modtager en tekst, en oversættelse eller en tekst komponeret af sprogmedarbejderen, forventer han, at den giver mening og har nogenlunde samme sproglige karakteristika som de autentiske tekster, han plejer at læse; oversættere skal ikke være eksperter på det faglige indhold, men må kunne formidle det uden forvrængning. Sprogmedarbejderen må konsultere faglige tekster på kilde- og målsprog efter behov. Vi ved, at ikke alle fagfolk er lige sprogbevidste, og derfor er det vigtigt at sammenholde kilderne for at konstatere uoverensstemmelse eller diskrepans med hensyn til faglige eller sproglige forhold, eksempelvis typisk syntaks og kollokationer.

					<dc:description>Studies of the sources of innovations have recognized that many innovations are developedby users. However, the fact that firms employ communities of users to strengthen their innovationprocess has not yet received much attention. In firm-established user communities users freely revealinnovations to a firm's product platform, which in turn puts the firm in a favorable position (a) becausethese new product features become available to all users by sharing on a user-to-user basis, or (b)because it allows the firm to pick up the innovations and integrate them in future products and thenbenefit by selling them to all users. We study the key personal attributes of the individuals responsiblefor innovations and the creation of value in this organizational context, namely the innovative users, toexplain why firm-established user communities work. Analyzing data derived from a web-basedquestionnaire generating 442 answers we find that innovative users are likely to be (i) hobbyists, anattribute that can be assumed to affect innovators' willingness to share innovations (positively), and (ii)responsive to `firm-recognition' as a motivating factor for undertaking innovation, which explainstheir decision to join the firm's domain. In agreement with earlier studies we also find that innovativeusers are likely to be `lead users', an attribute that we assume to affect the quality of user innovation.Whether or not a firm-established user community can be turned into an asset for the firm is to a greatextent conditioned by the issues studied in this paper.Keywords: Innovation, User community, User CharacteristicsJEL code(s): L21; L23; O31; O32</dc:description>

					<dc:description>`How becoming!' we say (though often with a subtle ironic twist) when someone says or does something that we find is suitable or appropriate for him- or her or the situation in which he or she is. And while it may be old-fashioned, the phrase is also used when the clothes people are wearing make them look attractive. By pronouncing: `how becoming!' we condone the appearance, the saying or the doing by making a reference to the appropriateness of somebody's attire, words and deeds. However, the appropriateness is situated in that it is based on cultural conventions of a particular time and space, and simultaneously produces culturally accepted boundaries around what denotes culturally intelligible identities or subject positions (parallel to suggesting that something is `for the likes of you/us' versus 'not for the likes of you/us' (Bourdieu, 1990:55-56)).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This article explores the case of product development for insights into the potential role of knowledge management. Current literature on knowledge management entertains the notion that knowledge management is a specific set of practices - separate enough to allow specialization of responsibility. By common standard, the proclaimed responsibility of knowledge management is shared knowledge, saved learning costs and coordinated action in an organization. The significance of the practices of knowledge management is the intention of shared knowledge, saved learning costs and coordinated action.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The aim of this paper is to explore technological roadmaps to identify key issuesconcerning the development and utilization of stem cells. From a review of the politicaldecision making processes in three countries, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germanywe suggest that technological roadmapping in this emerging and discontinuedtechnology can provide critical policy information. This type of policy intelligence canbe used to rethink the regulatory practices away from today's framework basedregulation of the emerging technologies towards a regulatory policy based on how todevelop regulatory practices based on the content and visions of the technologies inquestion. In the conclusion we discuss that the positive side effect of such a shift in theregulatory paradigm is that technological roadmapping can be used as a planning tool todeal with priorities in the health care system when the technologies are in its embryonicstage.Key words: Stem cell technologies, Roadmap, S&amp;T policy.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Master of Public Administration (MPA) uddannelsen ved Handelshøjskolen i København er i fokus for denne artikel. Jeg vil sætte kritisk lup på den pædagogiske praksis, som den har udviklet sig på uddannelsen. Formål er både at blive klogere på denne praksis og at komme forslag til overvejelser om ændringer. Dette er naturligvis ikke helt let, fordi jeg selv har været og er meget været aktiv omkring denne uddannelse. Jeg var således blandt initiativtagerne til uddannelsen i begyndelsen af 90'erne, og jeg var stadigvæk i 2001 aktiv på uddannelsen som studieleder2 .Jeg har derfor sikkert en del blinde pletter vedrørende uddannelsen. Jeg synes således fortsat, at de grundlæggende tanker bag uddannelsen er hensigtsmæssige3. (Se skema om indhold nedenfor). Derfor er formål for uddannelsen og studiets struktur ikke til diskussion her. Heller ikke en grundlæggende holdning om betydningen af, at uddannelsen både skal være teoretisk og praksisnær Den pædagogiske diskussion, som tages op her, er derfor også lettere, fordi den ikke rokker ved de grundlæggende præmisser for uddannelsen. Den bliver imidlertid heller aldrig bliver færdig, fordi vi aldrig præcist kan vide, hvad der kommer ud af vore anstrengelser, og fordi der altid kan peges på forbedringer. Det skal også nævnes, at det ikke er første gang, MPA uddannelsen analyseres. Initiativtagerne til uddannelsen har således beskrevet og analyseret opstarten på MPA og de mange faglige og pædagogiske overvejelser, vi den gang gjorde os4 Nærværende artikel kan ses som supplerende til den gamle artikel, idet der meget bevidst er valgt nogle andre teoretiske bidrag end dem, vi diskuterede som led opbygningen af uddannelsen I den gamle artikel var temaer som 'action learning', tværfaglighed, underviserroller, deltagerroller og evaluering i fokus.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The study aims is to describe how the inclusion and exclusion of materials and calculative devices construct the boundaries and distinctions between statistical facts and artifacts in economics. My methodological approach is inspired by John Graunt's (1667) Political arithmetic and more recent work within constructivism and the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). The result of this approach is here termed reversible statistics, reconstructing the findings of a statistical study within economics in three different ways. It is argued that all three accounts are quite normal, albeit in different ways. The presence and absence of diverse materials, both natural and political, is what distinguishes them from each other. Arguments are presented for a more symmetric relation between the scientific statistical text and the reader. I will argue that a more symmetric relation can be achieved by accounting for the significance of the materials and the equipment that enters into the production of statistics. Key words: Reversible statistics, diverse materials, constructivism, economics, science, and technology.</dc:description>

The memoirs of great leaders and fix it by reading five minutes a day are sold in bundles at the airports around the world. The academic literature on the subjects is increasing rapidly, and within the last ten to fifteen years the public sector has come and more into focus, following the New Public Management wave. Many of concepts seem to become buzzwords, but the facts remain that the world is changing and so are/must the organizations. My focus is primarily on the public sector, but this sector can nowadays not be treated without looking at the private and the not for profit sector as well. Therefore - and because of my experience in trade unions and other voluntary organizations these organizations are incorporated in the paper</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This article is about how a constructivist observation of development within Human Resource Management (HRM) opens the possibility for communicating about development in the language of possibility, seen in contrast to a language of deficiency. HRM is discussed as a paradoxical development concept, where the paradoxical consists in that when one focuses upon a proactive development ideal from a linear development understanding, one develops regressively, directly counter to one's intentions. In this article two observation dimensions are developed, as well as two dimensions of how to cope with development on the background of the constructivist observation.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In recent years, intervention studies have become increasingly popular within occupational health psychology. The vast majority of such studies have focused on interventions themselves and their effects on the working environment and employee health and well-being. Few studies have focused on how the context and processes surrounding the intervention may have influenced the outcomes (Hurrell and Murphy, 1996). Thus, there is still relatively little published research that provides us with information on how to evaluate such strategies and processes (Saksvik, Nytrø, Dahl-Jørgensen, and Mikkelsen, 2002). This paper describes how organisation theory can be used to develop a method for identifying and analysing processes in relation to the implementation of work environment interventions. The reason for using organisation theory is twofold: 1) interventions are never implemented in a vacuum but in a specific organisational context (workplace) with certain characteristics, that the organisation theory can capture, 2) within the organisational sociological field there is a long tradition for studying organisational changes such as workplace interventions. In this paper process is defined as `individual, collective or management perceptions and actions in implementing any intervention and their influence on the overall result of the intervention' (Nytrø, Saksvik, Mikkelsen, Bohle, and Quinlan, 2000). Process evaluation can be used to a) provide feedback for improving interventions, b) interpret the outcomes of effect evaluation and c) replicate interventions in other settings minimising the number of pitfalls associated with a given intervention (Goldenhar et al., 2001).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper analyzes the foundations of regional knowledge and its long-term impact onthe region's companies' and how a particular knowledge has developed an ability tostay competitive within a specific technological field. The case illustrates how theCopenhagen region has been able to develop a dominating position in the global marketfor industrial enzymes from 1870-2004. The case of industrial enzymes shows how aregion has been able to build sustainable competitive advantages from its distinctivecompetencies. This is done through a mixture of outsourcing and in sourcing ofcompetencies, knowledge and technologies from other regions in a ramified set ofinteracting networks. The key personnel within the regions firms are deliberatelyallowed to engage in the formations of these non-disclosure network activities so thatprofessional knowledge communities has been established across regional boundariesand thereby formed the basis for globalization of the knowledge and the markets forindustrial enzymes. Last but not least the paper demonstrates how the region's majorfirm, Novozymes, the world-leading manufacturer of industrial enzymes, even beforethe term virtual organization came into fashion, positioned itself as an interactivepartner in the center of a globalized system of academic institutions, customers andclients.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In recent years, establishing successful collaborative arrangements and relationshipsbetween university, industry and public institutions has come to be seen as essential intransforming new scientific knowledge into new innovations and business ventures. Thefit between these very different actor groups has been treated as a contingent factor.However, little attention has been given to the managerial efforts that entrepreneurshave make to establish the fit between small firms, university research, and publicpolicies such as regulatory policies and R&amp;D policies through network-type structures.New biotechnology organizations are perfect objects to study these relationshipsbecause new biotechnologies and techniques predominantly come from the universitysector (Kenney, 1986; Yoxen; 1984; Zucker &amp; Darby, 1997; Robbins-Roth, 2001).From the perspective of the small biotechnology firms (SBFs,) this paper analyzes fourdifferent managerial strategies of how to create network structures to deal with theinterfaces between industry, university and public institutions. The research-orientedstrategy, the incubator strategy, the industrial-partnering strategy, and the policyorientedstrategy. The research-oriented strategy focuses narrowly on howbiotechnology firms transform scientific results into solid business plan or businessmodels revealing the aim of the technologies, services or products. The incubatorstrategy is concerned with localization and how to overcome specific types ofmanagerial problems in the initial stage of forming a business venture. The industrialpartneringstrategy is concerned with how to overcome the problem of bringing thetechnologies from an experimental stage at a research lab to be able to handle industrialprocesses and full-scale production. Last, but not least, the policy-oriented strategyfocuses on the problem of having products approved by the public authorities. The aimof the article is to demonstrate how SBFs over time develop network structures throughpatchwork-like activities, ongoing and overlapping activities, that serve as a blueprintfor the management</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The aim of this paper is to inquire into the role of socio-technical devices like value metrics and accounting in organizing the service market. The authors provide a case on how such devices participates in framing the market for transportation during the introduction of large-scale bridges. In addition to the traditional role of accounting as a representation device, the authors also show how these devices participate in performing the service economy - undermining and redrawing organizational boundaries in unexpected ways. The presence of multiple connections with socio-technical devices are then brought into an explanation of the overflowing and reconfiguration of the transportation market.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Based on a study of the emergence of EMA as a new managerial domain and of how EMA costs the environment, the paper examines the institutionalisation of EMA. This is accomplished by linking EMA to the broader discourse of economic efficiency. Moreover, the paper contends that the institutionalisation of EMA is supported through the legitimacy it produces for individuals (notably environmental managers) and organizations. Through the use of different metrics, EMA frames the environment in terms of the well known - money - and establishes equivalence between the actions to protect the environment and changes in the bottom line.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>It is a delicate matter to trade spot products and financial derivatives in energy markets. Op-posite to bond and stock markets, the underlying assets are real products and a significant partof the demand for them represents a real need for the products, which can only be substitutedaway with some difficulties or, in some cases, only in a prohibitively costly manner. This isparticularly true in the spot market, where the demand is almost always met, but where thespot price processes can be quite different from the spot price processes conventionally used inthe pricing of derivatives. This pattern of real demand is also the main reason for the existenceof the well-known convenience yield in energy markets.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper investigates the bringing into existence of a proto-institution, that is, a new practice, rule or technology that diffuses beyond the innovative setting, but which is not yet taken-for-granted in a field. A case study, conducted real-time, shows how a collaborative group of business actors deliberately develop a proto-institution. They transpose an institutional logic from another field and combine it with an institutional logic in the focal field to resolve a field-level problem. Enabling factors include a high level of institutional heterogeneity in the focal field, the use of inter-organizational networks, and actors embedded in multiple fields. The making of the proto-institution is intentional, yet the institutional building blocks and the apparent interests of actors are institutionally embedded. The results from this micro-dynamic analysis suggest revisions to current conceptualizations of institutional change processes. Keywords: Institutional change, proto-institution, cognition, institutional entrepreneurship, innovation, collaborative networks.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>ABSTRACT. This paper presents an argumentative case study of the discursive representation of risk, responsibility and political action in the Spanish media. The study uses a critical discourse analytical approach combined with theories on risk, agency and political communication in the media. It is argued that an application of the Toulmin model is useful for eliciting systematic overall repre-sentations of responsibility and agency in environmental crises such as the mad cow crisis as well as for revealing relationships between social domains such as moral, politics, economics and science in discourse. Discourse analysis shows that in the Spanish newspaper sample the focus was on the construal of high risk and on the construal of the national Spanish politicians, the EU and the Brit-ish nation as scapegoats. No responsibility was associated with consumers or other individual players. Political action was transformed into a moral respon-sibility on the part of the national and European politicians, constrained by economic and technical-scientific reality and represented as taking place only in the public sphere. KEY WORDS: CDA, World Risk Society, argumentation, media discourse, argumentation, responsibility, political action, Spanish government, environmental crises.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We describe the background and the basic funding mechanisms for the type of adjustable rate mortgageloans that were introduced in the Danish market in 1996. Each loan is funded separately by tap issuingpass-through mortgage bonds (`strict balance principle'). The novelty is a funding mechanism that usesa roll-over strategy, where long term loans are funded by sequentially issuing short term pass-throughbonds, and the first issuer of these loans obtained a patent on the funding principles in 1999. Publiclyavailable descriptions of the principles leave an impression of very complicated numerical algorithms.The algorithms described here show that the essentials can be reduced to a `back of an envelope' complexity.Keywords: Adjustable rate mortgages, balance principle, patent, yield curve riding</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Recent years have seen large swings in house prices in many countries. Motivated by housing price variations, proposals for taxing capital gains on housing have repeatedly been put forth. The idea seems to be that such taxes would curb the redistribution occurring between those owning houses and those trying to get into the market for owner-occupied housing. Our paper shows that at least in simple settings, a tax on real capital gains on housing will only lead to even bigger price swings and will not be able to redistribute between people appearing on either side of the housing market.Keywords: capital gains tax, housing market, price fluctuationsJEL-Classification: H23, H24, R 31.Addresses:</dc:description>

					<dc:title>A Four-Dimensional Product Innovativeness Typology : Introducing Seven New Product Project Types for the Study of Innovation Management</dc:title>

					<dc:description>Product innovativeness is a key moderating variable for the study of innovationmanagement (Song &amp; Montoya-Weiss 1998, p. 124). For this reason, some empiricalstudies of innovation management examine new product processes, critical successfactors, and market learning practices for incremental versus discontinuous newproduct projects (Song &amp; Montoya-Weiss 1998; Atuahene-Gima 1995; Veryzer 1998a;Lynn et al. 1996; O'Connor 1998; Rice et al. 1998). By looking at both these types ofnew product development projects, empirical observations are likely to be morerealistic than those of studies that do not discriminate between more or lessinnovative projects.Even so, a dualistic view of the matter does not capture the nuances (Green et al.1995)1 of the relationship between product innovativeness and innovationmanagement practices. Hence, there is a need for richer innovativeness typologiesthat go beyond the dichotomous view and, thereby, lend themselves to a more finegrainedstudy of innovation management practices for different types of newproduct projects.In fact, various innovativeness typologies exist that include more than two producttypes. Notably, the typology by Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton (1982)2 introduces twodimensions: newness to the market and newness to the company, resulting in six productstypes (with various combinations of high, medium and low newness). An alternativeset of typologies differentiates between the product's technological newness and itsmarket newness, for example Abernathy &amp; Clark's (1985) typology with four newproduct types; Leonard-Barton's (1995) five product types; and Veryzer's (1998a)four types in a two-by-two matrix.Interestingly, these two meta-perspectives on product innovativeness (i.e. 1. new tothe market and/or new to the company and 2. technological and/or marketnewness) are generally not included within the same typology in extant literature.For example, discussions of the technological and/or market newness of a product,often leave out the question of whether that newness is in the eyes of the industryand market (exogenous newness) or only for the focal firm itself (endogenousnewness). More broadly, it can be stated that `... little continuity exists in the newproduct literature regarding from whose perspective this degree of newness is viewedand what is new' (Garcia &amp; Calantone 2002, p. 112).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Based on diverse research methods, we trace and map industrial economics research in Denmark, Norway and Sweden in the periode of 1880 to 1908. After describing this research in terms of key contributors, we argue that industrial economics developed rather unevenly in the Scandinavian countries. Danish research was mainly theoretical and strongly oriented towards the international context, whereas Norwegian research was largely industry analysis with a strong leaning towards managerial economics. Swedish research in industrial economics is very scant until the end of the 1960s.JEL Code: B1, B2, B3, D2, D4, L1, L2, L4</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Much of the knowledge management literature tends to assume a rather universalistunderstanding of knowledge sharing. Yet, attitudes to knowledge sharing as well as actualknowledge-sharing behaviour depend on conditions that vary across institutional and culturalenvironments. This paper contributes to the knowledge-sharing literature by specificallydiscussing the interplay between knowledge-sharing and national cultural factors in the context oftransition countries. The paper engages in a comparative examination of two major transitionsocieties, China and Russia, and contributes to understanding the complexity of differencesbetween transition economies. The paper is written as a set of theoretical arguments andpropositions that is designed to elucidate more nuanced ways of thinking about knowledgesharing in China and Russia. We argue that in the case of China and Russia, verticalindividualism and particularist social relations facilitate knowledge sharing. We also maintainthat there are important differences between China and Russia in terms of motivation forknowledge sharing and propose that the differences between the two countries in terms of originsof collectivism and degree of collectivism impact on knowledge sharing in organisations in thesetwo countries. Research and management implications are also outlined.Keywords: China, knowledge sharing, national culture, Russia</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper is a study of the knowledge-sharing difficulties experienced by three departments in a knowledge-intensive firm. The case organization is a global consulting firm that has been on the forefront of knowledge management and has won several knowledge management related international acclaims. Our analysis shows that there are strong disincentives in place for departments to share knowledge. We found that the nature of the businesses of the departments was very different and so were their knowledge requirements and their preferred ways to seek knowledge. Additionally, confidentiality agreements with clients and lack of cross-departmental interaction inhibited knowledge sharing outside departmental boundaries. Contrary to the common belief in the organization, we found that one single IT system could not satisfy the contextspecific knowledge-sharing needs of the different departments. We suggest that some very recent breakthrough technologies could be applied to facilitate cross-departmental knowledge sharing provided they are implemented at the strategic organizational level.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Thinking Aloud Thinking Aloud is the most commonly used technique used to test users´ interaction with computers. The assumption is that Think Aloud gives access to what goes on in the users´ minds. However, interfaces are multi modal and play heavily on user´s visual perception. Reflecting upon Think Aloud (TA), we ask the question: what happens when users are required to verbalise their visual perceptions and interactions? We argue that TA may have a disruptive effect, suggesting that other techniques be considered. With a theoretical distinction between focal and subsidiary awareness and a focus on the sense making process, we develop a frame for test of user´s visual interaction which rely on the coordination between hand/mouse and eye/cursor.Author Keywords: Think Aloud, visual perception, interaction, test</dc:description>

					<dc:description>All knowledge is context dependent. The relevant context is the social community where it resides, i.e. the `epistemic community' formed as groups of people define and legitimize the knowledge they possess. In the mutual engagement in a common enterprise, epistemic communities develop, maintain and nurture the codes, tools and theories that provide the basis of their practice. Commonalities of code, tools and theory facilitate both voluntary transfer and involuntary imitation of knowledge within communities, also ones spanning organizational boundaries. Conversely, knowledge transfer between different epistemic communities, whether desired or unintended, is often cumbersome and fraught with difficulties. In order to achieve effective integration and cooperation between its various professional communities and subcultures, firms must therefore undertake investments in boundary-spanning mechanisms. Since these investments are specific to the context in which they take place and to the transactions that they enable, they cannot easily be organized through arm's length contracts. Firms exist because they have a relative advantage over markets in the integration of diverse knowledge. However, the associated capabilities need not translate into a relative advantage also in the transfer of knowledge, i.e. knowledge exchanged between members of the same epistemic community. Within communities, knowledge disseminates with relative ease both intentionally and through emulation. Knowledge thus acquired can generally be applied also outside the context of the exchange and the effort or investment expended in its acquisition is not transaction specific. The governance mode applied in such exchanges is therefore determined by strategic and contextual factors, including those of traditional transaction cost logic.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper examines the implications of that workers may not be ableto estimate their true costs of acquiring skills. Consequently, too fewworkers may acquire skills. This allows for the possibility that subsidizingeducation is welfare improving. Furthermore, if the presence of skill-biasedtechnological shocks increase unemployment, this may explain why themarket it-self cannot respond to this by making it sufficiently attractiveto acquire skills. Consequently, the trade-off in-between subsidizing educationand thereby reducing unemployment and optimizing welfare maybe eliminated. We analyse this issue in a simple educational model andnext in a search equilibrium model including a skill choice decision.Keywords: Education, subsidies, efficiency, unemployment.JEL codes: I20, J64.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper investigates the pricing of step-up bonds, i.e. corporatebonds with provisions stating that the coupon payments increase as thecredit rating level of the issuer declines. To assess the risk-neutral ratingtransition probabilities necessary to price these bonds, we introduce a newcalibration method within the reduced-form rating-based model of Jarrow,Lando, and Turnbull (1997). We also treat split ratings and adjust forrating outlook. Step-up bonds have been issued in large amounts in theEuropean telecom sector, and we find that, through most of the sample,step-up bonds issued by the two largest issuers have traded at a discountrelative to comparable fixed-coupon bonds from the same issuers. Ourfindings cannot be attributed to traditional liquidity factors, and they suggestthat issuing step-up bonds increased the cost of capital for the issuers.Keywords: defaultable bonds, step-up coupons, rating-based modelsJEL classification: G12, G13</dc:description>

We estimate the model using U.S. asset market data from 1871 to2000, using both dividends and earnings as state variables. We find that current dividendsdo not forecast future utility shocks, whereas current utility shocks do forecastfuture dividends. The estimated structural model produces a sequence of predictedutility shocks which provide better forecasts of future long-horizon stock market returnsthan the classical dividend-price ratio.KEYWORDS: Randomutility, asset pricing, maximumlikelihood, structuralmodel,return predictability</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Internationalization offers enhanced opportunities for individuals to place savingsabroad and evade domestic saving taxation. This paper asks whether the concomi-tant loss of saving taxation necessarily is harmful. To this end we construct a modelof many symmetric countries in which public goods are financed by taxes on savingand investment. There is international cross-ownership of firms, and countries areassumed to be unable to tax away pure profits. Countries then face an incentiveto impose a rather high investment tax also borne by foreigners. In this setting,the loss of the saving tax instrument on account of international tax evasion mayprevent the overall saving-investment tax wedge from becoming too high, and hencemay be beneficial for moderate preferences for public goods. A world with 'high-spending' governments, in contrast, is made worse off by the loss of saving taxes,and hence stands to gain from international cooperation to restore saving taxation.JEL-Classifcation: H87, H21Keywords: Capital income taxation, cross-ownership, coordination</dc:description>

					<dc:title>Internal corporate venturing during organisational change : A study of how organisational identity influences the strategy-making process</dc:title>

					<dc:description>Organisations have to deal with increasingly complex and turbulent environments, which demand that they continuously change and adapt to new circumstances or challenges. One way for organisations to cope with these challenges is to manage the strategy-making process in order to ensure that a continuous stream of new ideas and initiatives create new opportunities and ensure that the company stays viable by adapting to new internal and external challenges. This has been pursued in studies of strategy formation (Mintzberg, 1978), strategic change (Pettigrew, 1988) and internal corporate venturing (Burgelman, 1983b, 2002) and is still a central issue in the strategic management discourse. It is generally acknowledged that continuous change is important for organisations' survival in a changing world. On the other hand the need for stability and continuity in form of a clear and strong corporate identity is also acknowledged to be critical for organisational success (Collins &amp; Porras, 1994). Where the organisational identity works to ensure consistency in the company's strategic action, the strategy making process works to renew the current concept of strategy (Burgelman, 1983b). Organisations thus face a dilemma when they engage in strategy-making to reconcile the perpetual tension between continuity and change (Burgelman, 2002). This challenge is far from new and has been discussed as e.g. the balance between exploration and exploitation (March, 1991).This article attempts to answer the question of how organisational actors' perception of organisational identity influences the strategy-making process during organisational change. The study adopts an evolutionary approach to the unfolding of the strategy-making process, using the variation-selection-retention framework of cultural evolutionary theory (Aldrich, 1999; Campbell, 1969; Weick, 1979), which has been applied to the strategy-making process by Burgelman in several of his works (Burgelman, 1983a, 1983b, 1991, 2002, 2003).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Ownership is determined by firm specific factors and the environment. Firms change over their life-cycle. The governance cycle - here defined as changes in identity of the dominant owner and own-ership concentration - is marked by key phases including start-up, growth, and possibly a restructur-ing or exit stage. During transition the cycle reflects: privatization often with a high proportion of employee ownership like in Russia and in Slovenia; strong pressures for restructuring and owner-ship changes; limited possibility for external finance because of embryonic development of the fi-nancial system. To provide simple hypothesis tests, we use Russian enterprise data for 1995-2003 and Slovenian data covering 1998-2003. In spite of differences in institutional development, con-cerning privatization and development of corporate governance institutions, we find that govern-ance cycles are broadly similar in the two countries. Employee ownership is rapidly fading, but while change to manager and non-financial domestic outsider ownership is typical for Russia, man-ager ownership is not widespread in Slovenia. Instead change to financial outsiders in the form of Privatization Investment Funds is frequent. Foreign ownership, which is rare especially in Russia, is quite stable. The ownership diversification to employees and diversified external owners during privatization did not fit well to the low development of institutions. As expected we observe in both countries a subsequent concentration of ownership on managers, external domestic and foreign owners.

					<dc:description>The concept of `distance' has been used by international business scholars to explain variations in international business strategies and operations across countries. The more distant a host country is from the organizational centre of a multinational enterprise (MNE), the more it has to manage cultural, regulatory and cognitive differences, and to develop appropriate entry strategies, organizational forms, and internal procedures to accommodate these differences. Scholarly research has focused on the concept of psychic distance, which has been narrowed down in empirical work to indices based on Hofstede's work on culture. However, these measures capture only very partially the dimensions of distance of concern to international business. In this paper, we show how the broader theoretical concept of institutional distance, which incorporates normative, regulatory and cognitive aspects, affects entry strategies. Specifically, our theoretical arguments suggest that the impact of distance varies with different aspects of the concept of institutional distance, and that this impact interacts with both the investor's experience and with the relative importance of the pertinent operation for the investing MNE. Using a unique dataset of foreign direct investment in emerging economies that incorporates multi-host as well as multi-home countries, we find empirical support for our propositions, and provide an explanation for apparently inconsistent results in the previous literature.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper deals with methodological issues of assessing the composition and level ofheterogeneity of firms' intellectual assets. It develops an original metric - referred to asthe H-index - for measuring heterogeneity using data extracted from patent documents.The main purpose is to improve the characterisation of research activities within firmsin the biotechnology sector. Although the H-index grew out of research on biotechfirms, the metric carries broader relevance for all patent-intensive industries. Themeasurement and calculation of the H-index is illustrated using some empiricalexamples from our preliminary study on Scandinavian biotech firms.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In April 2004, Copenhagen Business School opens a centre for research on biotech business. Biotech Business includes a number of senior and junior researchers from CBS. Initially the centre takes its point of departure in four projects included in the research program on Competence, Organisation and Management in Biotech Industries (COMBI). Starting in March 2004, COMBI is funded jointly by The Danish Social Research Council, firms and organisations in the Danish biotech industry and CBS. This presentation refers exclusively to four COMBI projects.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Price-earnings ratios are part of the toolkit that is used for assessing the valuation ofindividual firms on the stock market as well as the entire market itself. This paperpresents consistent P/E series for the liquid Danish shares adjusted for share buybacks.The results show that over the period from 1969 to 2003, the average (trailing)P/E equals 13.5. The P/E reaches its lowest level in 1980, which is likely to be due toa soaring oil price, high wage increases and interest rates approaching 20 percent.Notwithstanding optimistic equity pricing also in Denmark in the late 1990s, theupturn in Danish valuations was more moderate than in the US. The correction thatsets in subsequently reversed essentially the gains in the Danish P/E in the 1990s.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Participation rate on the Greenland labour market: situation of year 2000A goal is that a large part of the population of normal working age is employed. The participationrate is one of the statistics used to describe the performance of the economy in this respect. Twosources are used to arrive at an estimate of the rate both for Greenland in general and for fourregions defined by four so called growth towns: Nuuk, Sisimiut, Ilulissat and Qaqortoq. They areStatistic Greenland's publications on employment and on unemployment. There are somedifficulties using the available data: the employment and unemployment surveys refer to periodswhereas the potential workforce is counted at a date. Furthermore persons with yearly incomebelow an arbitrary limit of 40.000 DKK are sorted out even though they should contribute to thenumber of full year employed. The participation rate is found to be much higher in Nuuk than in theother regions. For Greenland as such the number is in line with figures for Western Europe andNorth America. Characteristics of people not in the work force are looked for. To some extent aconnection exists to the number people receiving pension as disabled, people in education, andthose on leave because of childbirth, but the relation is imperfect and great differences are seenbetween regions.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Unternehmen, Institutionen und Organisationen setzen zunehmend auf elektronische Kommunikati-on (1). Vor diesem Hintergrund legt der Artikel erste Ergebnisse einer Pilotstudie zum sozialen und technischen Umfeld der Text- und Medienproduktion in dänischen Organisationen vor. Kommuni-kations- und Informationschefs sowie Kommunikationsberater wurden befragt zu: Kommunikati-onsstrategie, Nutzung digitaler Kommunikationsformen und gewünschte Mitarbeiterqualifikationen (2, 3). Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse lauten: Das Intranet soll besser strukturiert und vereinfacht wer-den, ausserdem soll es vermehrt als Forum für den Dialog genutzt werden. Bei der Nutzung digita-ler Kommunikationsformen dominiert die E-Mail. Andere Medien wie Homepages oder TV/Film werden, je nachdem, ob sie der internen oder der externen Kommunikation dienen, als unterschied-lich bedeutsam gewertet. Bei den Mitarbeiterqualifikationen stehen persönliche und soziale Kompe-tenzen sowie Vermittlungsfähigkeiten und -fertigkeiten im Vordergrund, nicht technisches Spezia-listentum. Handwerkliches Können bei der Produktion von Texten und anderen Kommunikations-inhalten sowie generelles Wissen über Vor- und Nachteile der einzelnen Medien werden als wichti-ge Voraussetzungen für die Meisterung zunehmend strategisch geprägter Aufgaben angesehen (4). Da sich die Studie auf dänische Organisationen beschränkt, wären vergleichbare Untersuchungen in anderen Ländern wünschenswert (5).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The theoretical discourses devoted to smell reflect a maze of fascinating taboos and mysterious attractions. In present-day Western societies, the sense of smell is undervalued. Scents are highly elusive and often cannot be directly named. Many languages have virtually no vocabulary to describe them, except in terms of the other senses of sight, sound, touch and taste. Scents are communicated primarily through metaphors. What are these linguistic and visual metaphors, and what do they tell us about the societies and cultures in which they are used? How do we know what scents `mean'? Is smell a universal form of semiotic communication (as global advertising campaigns suggest), or does it vary in different social and cultural contexts (as anthropological and other literature asserts)? Are there specific `scent cultures'? If so, in what do they consist? And how do these affect the creation, appraisal and use of fragrances in the three countries - Japan, France and the USA - in which I intend to conduct my research?</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The relative demand for skills has increased considerably in many OECD countriesduring recent decades. This development is potentially explained by capital-skillcomplementarity and high growth rates of capital equipment. When productionfunctions are characterized by capital-skill complementarity, relative wages and employmentof skilled labor are countercyclical because capital equipment is a quasi-fixed factor in the short run. The exact behavior of the two variables depends onrelative wage flexibility. Relative wages are rigid in Denmark, implying that the employmentshare of skills should be countercyclical. The labor market is competitivein the United States and therefore relative wages of skilled labor are expected to becountercyclical. We find that the business cycle development of the two economiesis consistent with capital-skill complementarity.Keywords: capital-skill complementarity, relative wages, business cycle</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Organizations perform evaluations in order to demonstrate their trustworthiness to theoutside world and to produce knowledge for use by the management of the organization.In the planning and application of specific evaluations in the organization, differentparticipants or stakeholders very often disclose different, hidden or conflicting agendas.In recent years, the use of evaluations in organizations has grown rapidly and we havewitnessed the rise of a new bureaucratic instrument in the realm of knowledgeproduction in organizations, viz., internal evaluations. Such evaluations produce a set ofdata as part of the evaluation process and the long-term impact of this new systematicallyorganised set of data on organizational activities are normally not taken seriously intoconsideration when the use of evaluations in organizations are discussed. Saiddifferently, evaluations have become a major factor in the management of organizations,but the academic literature on internal evaluation very rarely discusses the impact of thisinstrument on the long term behaviour and activity of members of the organization. Thislacuna in the literature persists despite the well known fact, established by numerousstudies of organizational sociology, that people tend to adapt to external behaviouraldemands especially when related to power relations in the organization.keywords: research evaluation, governance, social control, publication counts.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Previous work on board size effects in closely held corporationshas established a negative correlation between board size and firm performance.We argue that this work has been incomplete in analysing the causalrelationship due to lack of ownership information and weak identificationstrategies in simultanous equation analysis. In the present paper we reexaminethe causal relationship between board size and firm performance using adataset of more than 5,000 small and medium sized closely held corporationswith complete ownership information and detailed accounting data. We testthe potential endogeneity of board size by using a new instrument given bythe number of children of the founders of the firms. Our analysis shows thatboard size can be taken as exogenous in the performance equation. Furthermore,based on a flexible model specification we find that there is noempirical evidence of adverse board size effects in the typical range of threeto six board members. Finally, we find a significantly negative board sizeeffect in the minority of closely held firms which have comparatively largeboards of seven or more members.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In this paper, we set up a two-country general equilibrium modelwhere trade unions have wage bargaining power. We show that adecrease in trade distortions inducing further product market integrationgives rise to specialization gains as well as a labour market reformeffect. The implications of the specialization gains are similar to anincrease in labour productivity, whereas the labour market reform effectis similar to an increase in the degree of competition in the labourmarket. Wages, employment and welfare increase as a result of furtherproduct market integration. It is interesting to note that the labourmarket reform effect of product market integration is achieved despitean increase in the wage level.JEL Classification: F15, J30, J50.Keywords: Trade frictions, wage formation, employment, welfaregains.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Recent studies of the impact of science parks have questioned traditionalassumption about the effect of the parks on innovation and economic growth.Most studies tend to measure the effect by rather traditional measures, revenue,survival of new firms, without taking into account, that knowledge has gained agrowing importance in the new economy. If we shift focus to organizationtheory discussions on new knowledge and innovation has specialized in relationto the process of creation, managing, organizing, sharing, transferring etc. ofknowledge. The evaluation of science parks has to relate to the changed role ofknowledge in the creation of economic growth. With the help of the concept ofthe ba from Nonanka, the article discuss if or how traditional organized scienceparks can become central actors in the new knowledge production or has to beviewed as an outdated institution from the industrial society.Keywords: knowledge creation, ba, science parks, knowledge management</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Fremvæksten af modus 2 forskning stiller krav om en revurdering af højere læreanstalters evaluerings- og meriteringspraksis. Den endimensionale prioritering af modus 1 forskning såvel som dennes ligeså endimensionale evaluering via publikationer må afvises som utidssvarende. Som en konsekvens heraf udvikles en konkret model til evaluering af forskningsmiljøers modus 2 indsats. Modellen kan støtte strategiske budgetteringsovervejelser på de højere læreanstalter og i samfundet som helhed. Modellen søger ikke at vurdere modus 2 forskningens værdi, men tilstræber derimod alene en modus 2 aktivitetsregistrering under den i såvel modus 1 som modus 2 konceptet iboende forudsætning, at forskningen bedst værdisættes af interessenterne. De strategiske budgetteringsovervejelser og den heraf følgende ressourceallokering til forskningsmiljøerne foregår under den realistiske forudsætning, at højere læreanstalter fungerer som heterogene konglomerater præget af urelateret diversificering, hvorfor principperne fra den strategiske porteføljeplanlægning kan anvendes.</dc:description>

					<dc:title>Measuring Consumer Reactions to Sponsoring Partnerships Based upon Emotional and Attitudinal Responses</dc:title>

					<dc:description>Consumers' reactions from being exposed to sponsorships has primarily been measured and docu-mented applying cognitive information processing models to the phenomenon. In the paper it is argued that such effects are probably better modelled applying models of peripheral information processing to the measurements, and it is suggested that the effects can be measured on the atti-tudes-towards-the sponsor and on the emotion-towards-the sponsor levels. This type of modelling is known as the ELAM model, however the types of independent variables involved is new to research into sponsorship effects. Two batteries of statements, attitude words and feeling words, are developed and a study is carried out with 470 respondents, randomly selected from the population. The data are analysed and pro-vide expressions of positive and negative attitude reaction and emotional reaction that show marked differences in consumer reactions towards sponsored objects of different natures as well as towards potential sponsoring organisations. For instance, the charitable institutions measured in the study elicit larger negative emotional re-sponses than positive responses, corresponding to a negative Net Emotional Response Score (NERS). Amongst the potential sponsoring companies only one company - a tobacco manufacturer - show this profile in NERS. The variation in NERS between charitable institutions and sports insti-tutions is quite dramatic - and has a high face validity. When studying attitude responses (Net Atti-tude Response Score or NARS), the differences between sponsored institutions are much smaller, although the charitable institutions still show a structurally different profile from the cultural and sports institutions. The differences between companies in NARS are quite small and probably only significant in a few instances. The NERS and NARS data are used to illustrate a `goodness-of-fit' measurement that companies - or organisations looking for sponsors - can use to determine whether a potential arrangement has the ability to provide the desired effects on reactions. This goodness of fit is both applied to the net scores and to the full evaluations on the attitude and emotion batteries and it seems as if the latter approach will be richer in explanatory power for a potential sponsor.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper introduces an index of tax optimality thatmeasures the distance of some current tax structure from the optimal taxstructure in the presence of public goods. In doing so, we derive a [0, 1]number that reveals immediately how far the current tax configurationis from the optimal one and, thereby, the degree of efficiency of a taxsystem. We call this number the Tax Optimality Index. We show howthe basic method can be altered in order to derive a revenue equivalentuniform tax, which measures the size of the public sector. A numericalexample is used to illustrate the method developed.JEL Code: H21, H41.Keywords: Tax optimality index, excess burden, distance function.Authors Affiliations: Raimondos-Møller: Copenhagen Business School, CEPR,CESifo, and EPRU.

					<dc:description>In this paper an investigation of the pricing of callable annuities with interest-only(I-O) optionality is conducted. First the I-O optionality feature of callable annuities isintroduced. Next an algorithm for pricing callable annuities with I-O optionality usingthe finite difference methodology, is formulated. This is then used to investigate optimalstrategies of I-O bonds and impacts on prices from the I-O optionality. It is found thatthe I-O feature necessitates a simultaneous valuation of all elements of the callable I-Obond. Following this, the Greeks of the I-O bond are investigated. It is found that they are affected by the I-O feature, but only to a limited extent. Finally, a model of heterogenousprepayment decisions is incorporated into the framework. The model is extended to modelheterogeneity in the I-O exercise decisions. The incorporation of heterogeneity in borrowerdecisions is found to lead to reasonable causalities.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper describes the formation of the Durban Auto Cluster in the context of trade liberalization. It argues that the improvement of operational competitiveness of firms in the cluster is prominently due to joint action. It tests this proposition by comparing the gains from cluster activities in the areas of supplier development, human resource development, logistics, and benchmarking, and by contrasting the impact of joint action against a host of other variables, notably international competition and technical assistance by foreign partners.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Does wrongful conviction lower deterrence and can this explain society's aversion tosanctioning the innocent? This paper argues that for some of the most importantcategories of crime such as murder, assault or robbery, the answer to both questions isno. For these categories of crime, a potential offender need not fear wrongfulconviction for any particular criminal act he or she chooses not to commit. Forexample, if a potential offender decides not to murder another person, he or sheshould not fear being wrongfully convicted of it, since the person will not be dead,and there will therefore be no investigation and no trial. He of she may risk beingwrongfully convicted of another crime, but that risk exists independently of his or herown actions.It may be argued that wrongful conviction lowers deterrence in more indirect ways.First, the possibility of being sanctioned for a crime one does not commit may lowerthe threat of being sanctioned for a crime one commits, if two sanctions are not twiceas threatening as one. Second, if wrongful conviction halts further investigations thatmay lead to the true offender, and third, if a potential offender thinks that if he or shedoes not take advantage of a crime opportunity, he or she may be wrongly convictedin the event that some other person grasps the same opportunity. However, it will beargued that wrongful conviction may also increase deterrence, and the three indirecteffects are in any event unlikely to be quantitatively important in the real world.An implication of the present analysis is that society's aversion to sanctioning theinnocent cannot be rationalized by or reduced to a concern for deterrence.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are expanding their global reach, carrying their products and brands to ever more remote corners of the world. They encounter business environments that vary not only from their country of origin, but also vary greatly amongst each other. Thus foreign investors have to adapt their strategies, most notably their marketing and acquisition strategies, to the local context. In this paper, we outline why globalisation drives MNEs into emerging economies, and we provide conceptual frameworks that may aid investors to adapt their strategies to emerging economy contexts. MNEs have to develop a portfolio of local and/or global brands that matches their competences with local needs. If they aim for market leadership they may pursue a multi-tier strategy, but this needs to be supported by an appropriate foundation of global and local resources. This strategy in particular requires the acquisition of complementary local resources controlled by local firms. However, acquisitions in emerging economies are inhibited by institutional obstacles and weak local firms. Thus, foreign investors may pursue staged, multiple, indirect, or Brownfield acquisitions to build their projected operation. We illustrate our proposed strategies by analysing how one multination enterprise - Carlsberg Breweries - has developed its operations in three very different emerging economies: Poland, Lithuania and Vietnam.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We consider a simple model of international trade under uncertainty, whereproduction takes time and is subject to uncertainty. The riskiness of production dependson the choices of the producers, not observable to the general public, and these choicesare influenced by the availability and cost of credit. If investment is financed by abond market, then a situation may arise where otherwise identical countries end upwith different levels of interest and different choices of technique, which again impliesdifferences in achieved level of welfare. Under suitable conditions on the parametersof the model, the market may not be able to supply credits to one of the countries.The introduction of financial intermediaries with the ability to control the debtorsmay change this situation in a direction which is welfare improving (in a suitable sense)by increasing expected output in the country with high interest rates, while opening upfor new problems of asymmetric information with respect to the monitoring activity ofthe banks.Keywords: Capital outflow, financial intermediaries, moral hazardJEL classification: F36, D92, E44</dc:description>

					<dc:title>Trust as a Critical Concept</dc:title>

					<dc:description>In this articlei I will argue that trust is a fundamental and critical concept because trust is the direct or transcendental constitutive ground of most social phenomena, as well as applicable as an operational method in critical theory. There are two different but overlapping positions on trust I address in this article. One is the standpoint we find in business strategy, that trust is naïve to show, and control or contracts are presumed better. In the strategy game the idealistic good guys seems to lose (Arrow 1974), (Williamson 1975). The other position is the position taken by systems theory where trust is treated as if it was a value-neutral system-internal decision, which presupposes that trust and mistrust are symmetrically interrelated functionally (Luhmann 1979). In his early book Trust and Power, Niklas Luhmann seems to agree with the vision guiding my general argument that there is a need for clear directions and specifications in organisations and systems as to whether trust or distrust is appropriate and rational (Luhmann 1979:93). Yet I challenge these positions described above with an alternative understanding inspired by Jürgen Habermas which can be applied as an operational strategy for analyzing trust in its' empirical and social distribution, without ignoring the questions of validity in real social settings where trust is actively playing a direct or indirect constitutional role in the foundation of most interactions, organisations, institutions, and societies.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The EU internal market has predominantly been studied in terms of changes in delegation of authority and division of labor between EU institutions and member states. However, this EU internal focus ignores that already in 1987 the completion of the internal market was substantially left to the private European standardization organizations (ESO). The paper addresses two fundamental challenges in this transnational, public-private, and internal-external delegation of authority. First, it involves a governance challenge, because private actors are directly involved - but to a certain extent outside EU political and administrative control - in the constitution of the internal market. Second, the delegation raises important analytical questions concerning the identification of the institutional locus of European integration, when the realization of the political goals with the internal market is dependent on an inter-organizational coordination between the EU and ESO. Applying the analytical concept of a `policy field' the analysis shows how the completion of the internal market fundamentally challenges institutionalized conceptions of the role of politics in constituting markets.Keywords: Internal market, policy field, technical standards, transnationalization, new approach harmonization, private product policy</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Kinks and jumps in the payoff function of option contracts prevent an effectiveimplementation of higher-order numerical approximation methods. Moreover, thederivatives (the greeks) are not easily determined around such singularities, even withstandard lower-order methods. This paper suggests a transformation to turn the originalill-conditioned pricing problem into a well-behaved numerical problem. For astandard test case, both vanilla- and binary call price functions are approximated with(tensor) B-splines of up to 10'th order. Polynomial convergence rates of orders up toapproximately 10 are obtained for prices as well as for first and second order derivatives(delta and gamma). Unlike similar studies, numerical approximation errors aremeasured both as weighted averages and in the supnorm over a state space includingtime-to-maturities down to a split second.KEYWORDS: Numerical option pricing, Transformed state spaces, Higher-orderB-splines.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper suggests a method for determining rigorous upper bounds on approximationerrors of numerical solutions to infinite horizon dynamic programming models.Bounds are provided for approximations of the value function and the policyfunction as well as the derivatives of the value function. The bounds apply to moregeneral problems than existing bounding methods do. For instance, since strict concavityis not required, linear models and piecewise linear approximations can bedealt with. Despite the generality, the bounds perform well in comparison with existingmethods even when applied to approximations of a standard (strictly concave)growth model.KEYWORDS: Numerical approximation errors, Bellman contractions, Error bounds</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In this paper, Mie Augier and David Teece outline the history and development of the ideas underlying an emerging approach within strategic management research: the dynamic capabili-ties framework. The framework was first outlined by Teece and Pisano (1994), and in the pre-sent paper elaborated further so the reader will be able to appreciate some of the most impor-tant intellectual resources underpinning it, such as the work of Schumpeter, Penrose, William-son, Cyert and March, Rummelt, Nelson and Winter. Although listed as intellectual resources by the authors, they also turn (some of) them into a topic for further discussion. For example, Augier and Teece identify not only the merits but also the limitations of transaction costs eco-nomics. In this way, the authors pave the way for a more dynamic framework while drawing upon organization theory and scholars like Cyert and March (a behavioral theory of the firm) and Nelson and Winter (an evolutionary theory of economic change). In the dynamic capability framework firms and markets co-evolve. Managers are now allowed to perform distinct strate-gic roles in shaping both firms and their markets, e.g. through asset- selection and orchestra-tion, including also the task of allocating resources between exploitation and exploration.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In this paper, Mie Augier provides a rich description of the intellectual traditions, the signifi-cant people and academic institutions that in some way or another made a difference to Davis Teece's own intellectual development. In this sense, it is a dynamic account of the emerging career of a distinguished scholar - but not only that. It is also a description of the co-development of three major disciplinary fields; organization theory, economics and strategic management during three decades or so. David Teece has made several important contribu-tions, perhaps most notably to economics (on the theory of the firm and transaction cost eco-nomics) and strategic management (on dynamic capabilities) while drawing upon organization theory and notions such as organizational routines and bounded rationality. In addition, Augier also provides an interview with David Teece, a true scholar still unsettled with what has been achieved so far - in all three fields: `Maybe I'm wrong; and maybe technology is a special case and maybe technology and organization do not belong at the core of the theory of the firm. My intuition tells me otherwise.' (David Teece, quoted in this issue).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>ABSTRACT Working with usability techniques, with focus on how a given technique enables data capture made us ask the question: What kind of information is it an HCI expert want from the user when conducting a usability test? We answer the question by discussing two techniques both relying on concurrent data. Think Aloud is one of the most frequently used techniques and almost an institution in itself. Eye-tracking is new in usability testing and still at an experimental level in HCI. We reflect critically upon the two obtrusive techniques. We discuss the usability of concurrent data capture, suggesting participatory analysis and retrospective verbalisation as a possible step in usability testing.

					<dc:description>Think Aloud is cost effective, promises access to the user's mind and is the applied usability technique. But 'keep talking' is difficult, besides, the multimodal interface is visual not verbal. Eye-tracking seems to get around the verbalisation problem. It captures the visual focus of attention. However, it is expensive, obtrusive and produces huge amount of data. Besides, eye-tracking do not give access to user's mind. Capturing interface/cursor tracking may be cost effective. It is easy to install, data collection is automatic and unobtrusive and replaying the captured recording to the user and probing about her actions and thoughts open for participatory analysis.

					<dc:description>Abstract In this paper the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Research Group reports on the pre-phase of an e-learning project, which was carried out in collaboration with the client. The project involved an initial exploration of the problem spaces, possibilities and challenges for an online accredited Continued Medical Education (CME) programme at the Lundbeck Institute. The CME programme aims at end-users, which are primarily general practitioners, but also specialists (psychiatrist and psychologists), from all over the world. The assumption was that it would be possible to identify and build on resources and competencies already existing in the client organisation. We asked: What is it we know? Uncovering the prerequisites and background of and with the client allowed us concurrently to identify: What do we not know? Working iteratively in collaboration with the client, allowed us to build on existing resources and networks, suggesting a design, which also included end-users community needs and work-context. Our argument is that if a preparation phase both seeks to confirm knowledge and contemplate what is not yet known, giving attention to the context and need of the client (i.e. not only end-users,) then it is possible to build on existing resources within the client organisation, leading to grounding of design decisions and a match between the e-learning environment designed and the capabilities of the client.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper argues that society should vary the sanction applied to acriminal defendant with the weight of the evidence against him or her.This is optimal when it is costly for society to apply sanctions, since it canyield the same degree of deterrence while requiring fewer resources to bespent on sanctioning. Furthermore, when the unfairness of convicting aninnocent defendant increases with the size of the sanction, this provides afurther rationale for graduating sanctions with the probability of guilt.Some objections are briefly discussed, mainly that it is inherently unfairto apply different sanctions on people, who have committed the sameoffense, and that the legal system will lose legitimacy if it allows sanctionsto vary in the way suggested.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract: This article presents an empirical analysis of board composition and financial performance using a unique sample of Danish listed firms. In 2002, a group consisting of four prominent business leaders formulated Denmark's own code of good corporate governance, entitled the Nørby report, The report consists of various recommendations aiming at strengthen Danish firms competitiveness and value creation including some specific recommendations concerning board composition. However, the analysis shows that none of the recommendations impact Tobin's Q. Specifically, board size, proportion of insiders, positions held by board members in other firms do not significantly impact Tobin's Q. The analysis only finds that the average age of the board has a significantly negative impact on performance. Board diversity, measured by the fraction of women and foreigners in boards as well as the educational background of board members does not impact performance either.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractPrevious discussions of knowledge transfer within multinational corporations tended tofocus on the process as an isolated phenomenon and on the factors that impede the process.Less attention has been given to how the individual knowledge worker retrieves or identifies,and then decodes knowledge accessed from the corporate memory. We suggest thatmultinational companies (MNCs) solve knowledge retrieval problems by implementingvirtual communities of practice - intranet-based collaborative forums. Codification andpersonalization strategies have previously been emphasized as an either-or solution. Thesevirtual communities of practice combine the codification and personalization strategies,simultaneously utilizing the advantages of two approaches.</dc:description>

We focused on the role of thesubsidiary with regard to market, product and value-adding mandates. Further, weinvestigated whether the Hungarian subsidiaries had experienced an upgrade of theirrole during the first 10 years of transition. The host country economy was supportive torole development, but inadequate subsidiary capabilities and headquarters' assignmentsprevented the subsidiaries from being upgraded. We propose that the corporate immunesystem, ie, ethnocentric behaviours emanating from the headquarters should be includedin future upgrading analyses.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper presents the results of a survey of 54 Danish multinational corporations that haveacquired activities abroad. The role of the acquired R&amp;D units was the focus of the survey,particularly with respect to the schism between basic and applied R&amp;D, and the schismbetween autonomous and network R&amp;D. This paper establishes the connection between amultinational corporation that follows a capability-motivated acquisition strategy and theR&amp;D role new subsidiaries should play in order for the acquired resources to be utilizedcorporation-wide. Statistical findings reveal the need to follow a combination of basic andnetwork-oriented R&amp;D activities when focusing on capability development.Keywords: Acquisition; Research and Development (R&amp;D), Basic R&amp;D, Applied R&amp;D,Autonomy, Network, Capabilities.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractNot achieving the anticipated synergy effects in the post-acquisition integration context is a serious causefor the high acquisition failure rate. While existing studies on failures of acquisitions exist fromeconomics, finance, strategy, organization theory, and human resources management, this paper appliesinsights from the knowledge-sharing literature. The paper establishes a conceptual link between obstaclesin the post-acquisition integration processes and individual knowledge-sharing behavior as related toknowledge transmitters and knowledge receivers. We argue that such an angle offers important insights toexplaining the high failure rate in acquisitions.Descriptors: post-acquisition integration, acquisition failure, individual knowledge-sharing behavior</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractThe economics of property rights furthers the resource-based view in a number ofways. Resource analysis is refined by conceptualizing resources as composed ofmultiple attributes to which property rights may be held. A resource owner's abilityto create, appropriate and sustain value from resources depends on the propertyrights that she holds to those resources and on the transaction costs of exchanging,defining and protecting the relevant property rights. While transaction costs aremajor sources of value dissipation, value may be created by reducing suchdissipation. Implications for the RBV analysis of sustained competitive advantageare derived.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractDuring the last decade, strategy scholars have increasingly converged on organizationalcapabilities as a key construct in strategy research. We explicate some of the underlying,unstated assumptions of current capabilities-based work by drawing on seminal work in thephilosophy of social science, particularly the debate between methodological individualismand collectivism. We argue that a number of explanatory anomalies as well as the apparentlack of progress in capabilities-based work are partly due to much of capabilities-basedwork being based on collectivist notions that sidestep critical individual-levelconsiderations, including individual action and heterogeneity. In this note we do not denyor reject the notion of routines or capabilities per se, but rather call for an increasedemphasis on how these collective structures originate and change as a result of individualactions.Key words: Organizational capabilities, methodological individualism, philosophy ofsocial science</dc:description>

In particular, it is argued that TCE hasthe potential to remedy a number of weak spots in the RBV, such as theabsence of attention in the RBV to the interaction between value creation andvalue appropriation. This and other weak spots in the RBV stem from nottaking account of transaction costs to a sufficient extent. Integrating TCEwith the RBV adds new insight into the analysis of sustained competitiveadvantage.KeywordsThe resource-based view, transaction cost economics, sustained competitiveadvantage.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>According to Heinrich v. Pierer, CEO at Siemens, `an e-business year is only three months long. Ifyou want to be a leader in this fast-paced world, you must be faster than the others. Just being onboard is by far not enough'. The ability to be faster than others, however, is only relevant if it islinked to management of key assets in the pursuit of continuous competitive advantage. The keyasset of the present is knowledge and in the future it is likely to be continuous and timelyinnovation based on effective management of knowledge assets. Most firms today, however, lack aneffective Knowledge Management System. Although many companies have ManagementInformation Systems in place, this is only the first step in a knowledge-based company. Companiesthat understand and actively manage the process of designing, developing and advancing effectiveKMS' are likely to, in the words of Heinrich v. Pierer, `e-outperform competition and becomeleaders of the e-conomy'. Using examples from a number of large multinational companies thispaper proposes a phase model for the development of a global Knowledge Management Systemwith attention to pertinent policy and management issues in each stage.Keywords: Knowledge management system, phase-model, multinational corporation, managementactions</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The purpose of the paper is to determine and empirically examine the effect of human resourcemanagement practices on knowledge transfer within multinational corporations. It is suggested thatthe employment of human resource practices, which affect absorptive capacity of knowledgereceivers and support organizational learning environment, is positively related to the degree ofknowledge transfer to the subsidiary. Moreover, the higher degree of knowledge transfer isexpected when human resource management practices are applied as an integrated system ofinterdependent practices. Hypotheses derived from these arguments are tested on the data from 92subsidiaries of Danish multinational corporations located in 11 countries.Key words: knowledge transfer, multintional corporations, HRM, complementarity</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractThis talk addresses the interaction of knowledge and organization in IB research,particularly research on the MNC. The argument is made that although the MNCliterature is quite advanced with respect to its treatment of firm-level knowledge,several connected problems remain. In particular, there has been an over-emphasison knowledge flows and an under-emphasis on knowledge stocks; themicrofoundations of MNC knowledge are unclear; and there is a no clearunderstanding of the causal relations between knowledge stocks and flows andorganizational control. A control theory approach that may resolve some of theseproblems is then sketched.KeywordsThe MNC, knowledge, organizational control, control theory.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract: The paper presents an explorative study of Open Source Software (OSS) focusing on the managerial decisions for acquisition of OSS. Based on three case studies we argue that whereas small organizations often may chose adoption of OSS expecting significant cost savings, a major barrier for larger organizations' adoption of OSS lies in the organizations' consolidation of the enterprise architectures, in addition to that OSS will not be adopted before satisfactory delivery and procurement models for OSS are established. Keywords: Open Source Software, OSS, Enterprise Architecture, Total Cost of Ownership, Delivery and Procurement Model.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The main research interest in Open Source Software (OSS) has been in answering the questions of why individuals and organizations without economic compensation contribute to OSS projects and how these projects are organized. In this paper we instead focus on managerial decisions for acquisition of OSS and discuss potential barriers for widespread use of OSS. Based on existing literature and a small case study, we develop and discuss the hypothesis that a major barrier may be the `customer' organizations' uncertainty and unfamiliarity with the relationships with OSS `vendors'. To develop viable models for these relationships is an important challenge, which we will deal with in a research project, of which this paper should be seen as a first step.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper questions the prevailing notions that firms within industrial clusters have privi-leged access to `tacit knowledge' that is unavailable - or available only at high cost - to firms located elsewhere, and that such access provides competitive advantages that help to explain the growth and development of both firms and regions. It outlines a model of cluster dynam-ics emphasizing two mutually interdependent processes: the concentration of specialized and complementary epistemic communities, on the one hand, and entrepreneurship and a high rate of new firm formation on the other.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper focuses on the foreign debt management of the Hungarian and Slovenian policy makers in the global financial markets. The proposed argument combines a theoretical refinement of international financial markets as locally embedded social relations with a domestically oriented institutional analysis of foreign debt management. I argue that in order to understand the differences between the two states' debt management strategies, it is important to look at the institutional differences within which the strategies were proposed, rejected or accepted. At this level of analysis the paper also considers the links between globalization of finance and the changing role of the state.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The democratic deficit in the so-called bargaining democracy provides themotivation for constitutional efforts to limit the ability of different groups to formcoalitions that are able to grant benefits to themselves through legislation that moreor less directly benefit identifiable groups. A constitutional hierachy of laws thatstand in conflict is proposed. In this hierarchy more `rule-oriented' legislationdominate less `rule-oriented' legislation. The main purpose of the proposal is tocreate a momentum of the political process towards more rule-oriented policyactions and legislation, and to inspire the policy debate to focus on principles andrules to an increasing extent. At the same time, the difficulty of defining a rule asopposed to an outcome-oriented directive is avoided by limiting the task of aconstitutional court to simply rank conflicting policy actions with respect to thedegree actions satisfy criteria for rules.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In 1992 the Cadbury Committee report on the financial aspects of corporate governance waspublished. The Committee had been established following the failures of a number of highprofile businesses in the UK which had shaken confidence in the market. Some nine yearslater, in 2001, the collapse of Enron sent shockwaves through the US market. As a result of theEnron collapse and various other high profile scandals in the years since its occurrence, the USis examining its own corporate governance structures and provisions to determine how thesemight be improved and help avoid another Enron. The EU similarly is developing principlesand legislation to improve corporate governance, and scandals such as Royal Ahold andParmalat have helped drive further governance reforms.In this paper we detail the development of corporate governance codes in the UK and theadaptation of similar codes in the EU. We discuss the role of the financial sector in corporategovernance and how principles for regulation and supervision of the financial sectorcomplement codes of conduct and legislation in the area of corporate governance.JEL Classification numbers: G34, G28, G22, G23Keywords: corporate governance, financial sector; institutional investors.</dc:description>

Having no CNC allows the researcher toleave for a rival. This alleviates a commitment problem by forcing the firm to rewarda successful researcher. However, if the firm's R&amp;D investment mainly matters,including a CNC in the contract is optimal, as it ensures the firm's incentives toinvest.JEL Codes: J3, K2, L14, O31, O34.Keywords: Innovation, intellectual property rights, labor contracts, poaching, relationalcontracts, start-ups.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractWe analyze firms' incentives to cluster in an industrial district to benefit fromreciprocal technology spillovers. A simple model of cumulative innovation is presentedwhere technology spillovers arise endogenously through labor mobility. It isshown that firms' incentives to cluster are the strongest when the following threeconditions are met: 1) technological progress is rapid; 2) competition in the productmarket is relatively soft; 3) the probability of a single firm to develop an innovationis neither very high nor very low. We show that some trade secret protection is alwaysbeneficial for firms' profits and stimulates clustering. Excessive protection mayimpede technology spillovers and reduce firms' incentives to cluster.JEL Codes: J3, K2, L1, O32, O34.Keywords: Cumulative innovation, industrial districts, intellectual property rights,technology spillovers.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Contracts and exits from a sample of 179 investment rounds in 132 entrepreneurial firmsby 17 European venture capital (VC) funds are analyzed. The data indicate the financial contractsare quite heterogeneous in terms of both the cash flow and control rights. The use of differentsecurities by European VC funds does not depend on the definition of venture capital, and thesecurities used are not functional equivalents. A normative empirical analysis of exit shows thelikelihood of different types of exit vehicles (IPO, acquisition, and liquidation) and the returns toventure capital depend on not only firm specific characteristics but also the allocation of cashflow and control rights.Keywords: Venture Capital, Financial Contracting, Exit, IPO, AcquisitionJEL Classification: G24, G28, G31, G32, G35</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract:This paper contributes to the fundamental discussion of setting optimalliabilities in restitution law by analyzing the effects that the existingmultitude of indemnification rules for patent infringements have oninnovative and imitative activity. From a theoretical legal standpoint, thechoice of patent law is particularly enlightening due to its hybrid public andprivate nature. From an economic perspective its relevance lies in regulatingthe driving forces of welfare in highly industrialized societies. Our analysisof regulations from six different jurisdictions (US, JP, DE, UK, FR, NL)reveals that from a scholarly standpoint none of the regulations sets optimalliabilities in general. Our major finding is that an expectation damage rulebased on a renegotiation outcome from an ex-ante perspective (falling inbetween the generic legal notions of `lost profits' and `infringer's profits')between licensor and licensee appears optimal in patent infringement casesto avoid dynamic inefficiencies. The result is intuitive, however, was notpredicted by the existing literature on indemnification law.Keywords: Patents, litigation, damage awards, innovation,infringementJEL-Classifications: K41,L00, L20</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Investors choosing a portfolio strategy, in order to secure a pension at a future date forexample, are faced with many uncertainties. One major uncertainty is the amount bywhich their pension fund will be supplemented by personal savings from a variety of sourcessuch as life insurance contracts, bequests, or property sales. Over long periods of time theseuncertainties are likely to be large and difficult to hedge, and hence may have a significanteffect on the dynamic portfolio strategy. Drawing on the results of previous literature on thereaction of investors to non-unhedgeable background risk, and on the theory of stochasticdynamic programming, this article derives optimal strategies for investors maximising theexpected utility of terminal wealth, where this wealth consists of the value of a pensionfund plus accumulated personal savings. Numerical results, assuming that the marketportfolio and the expectation of personal savings follow (possibly) correlated geometricBrownian motions, are derived to illustrate the effects of the size and uncertainty of thepersonal savings, as well as the effect of the resolution of the uncertainty in them overtime. The computation uses a new technique for implementing the stochastic dynamicprogramming. This involves a binomial approximation, in two dimensions, which ensuresthat the computations are feasible for relatively long-term problems.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This article compares a set of often used simple contracts or mechanismsin terms of how well they allocate decision rights between twoagents over time. A basic assumption is that agents incur a fixed costeach time they renegotiate. The contracts or mechanisms studied are:individual ownership and authority, the first-come first-serve rule, the alternating rule and the sign-up rule. One trade-off that arises is thefollowing: when usage of the asset is flexible in the sense that it doesnot matter in which period it occurs, agents may rely on obtaining theasset through arriving first at some point, while when an agent needs totime and plan the use of the asset, he or she may wish to hold strongerrights or to use the sign-up rule as a simple form of contracting. (JEL:D10, D23, L22); Keywords: Incomplete contracts, individual ownership,first-come first-serve rule, costly renegotiation.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper explains two fundamental approaches to knowledge management. The tacitknowledge approach emphasizes understanding the kinds of knowledge that individualsin an organization have, moving people to transfer knowledge within an organization,and managing key individuals as knowledge creators and carriers. By contrast, theexplicit knowledge approach emphasizes processes for articulating knowledge held byindividuals, the design of organizational approaches for creating new knowledge, andthe development of systems (including information systems) to disseminate articulatedknowledge within an organization. The relative advantages and disadvantages of bothapproaches to knowledge management are summarized. A synthesis of tacit andknowledge management approaches is recommended to create a hybrid design for theknowledge management practices in a given organization.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper studies how interest group lobbying of the bureaucracy affects policyoutcomes and how it changes the legislature's willingness to delegate decision-makingauthority to the bureaucracy. We extend the standard model of delegation to accountfor interest group influence during the implementation stage of policy and apply itto different institutional structures of government. The paper addresses the followingquestions: First, how does the decision to delegate change when the bureaucratic agentis subject to external influence? What cost does this influence impose on the legislativeprincipal? Finally, how susceptible are policy choices to bureaucratic lobbying underdifferent government structures? In answering these questions, the paper seeks to providea comparative theory of lobbying and to explain the different patterns of interestgroup activity across political systems.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In the 1990s, most of the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) went throughradical liberalization and adopted large-scale economic and political reform programs. Theseprograms included almost complete price, trade and capital movement liberalization,macroeconomic stabilization, currency reform, and small-scale and large-scale privatization.What is the role of the development of a legal and institutional infrastructure along with theseradical changes in society and the economy? The first part of this paper is based on the resultsof an interview study of entrepreneurs and managers in Estonia undertaken in 1998 and inEstonia, Russia, Finland and Sweden in 2000 in order to obtain their view of the behavior ofgovernment agencies, lawmaking procedures and the operation of law enforcementmechanisms.The second part of this paper presents summary results from interview surveys of Estonianmanufacturing firms undertaken from 1994-2000. The surveys were designed toquantitatively measure the state of and changes in the Estonian business environment,focusing on the key aspects of financial contractual relationships of Estonian manufacturingfirms as well as regulation and dispute resolution mechanisms. Among the observations it isnoted that government regulations do not seriously affect business decisions regarding theoperation, expansion or closing down of Estonian manufacturing firms. A second observationis that the Estonian court system is perceived as inadequate for resolving a substantial numberof disputes and conflicts among economic agents although legislation exists. Most firms relyon mechanisms of self-enforcement when possible.Journal of Economic Literature Classification numbers: K42, K49, G18, G30Keywords: business environment, corporate financial relationships, enterprise restructuring,corruption, law making procedures, law enforcement.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract: In this paper we present a cost effective and simple procedure for evaluating company web sites. Our assumption is that such sites are places for companies' self-presentation and that customers are readers of these texts. Web site texts with narrative qualities, e.g. scenes, actors, acts, initiate the customers' imagination and narrative mind and hence their decision making. These ideas are investigated in a qualitative study of two companies' self-presentation as future work places for students. The results demonstrate that the students choose the company that has a web site with rich narrative qualities above the company that has a web site with good graphical appearance, but poor narrative qualities. In conclusion, we suggest that user centred evaluation of commercial web sites by using the suggested method can pay attention to deep, narrative structures in both the company's self-presentation and the customers' reading of the web site texts.Keywords: Competitive advantage, decision-making, dramas, imagination, narratives, storytelling, web-design.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Dette projekt har til formål at undersøge en række virksomheders oplevelse af gevinster og omkostninger i forbindelse med miljømærkning. Projektet har afgrænset sig til virksomheder med Blomst- og/eller Svanemærkede produkter. Disse to miljømærker betegnes ofte som type 1. De bygger på en livscyklusvurdering og auditeres af 3. part. Hovedparten af virksomhederne i undersøgelsen har i høj eller nogen grad opnået deres mål med miljømærkningen. Desuden viser resultaterne, at en tredjedel af virksomhederne vurderer at indtægterne ved at indføre miljømærkning overstiger omkostningerne herved. De fleste virksomheder oplever også, at miljømærkningen i højere eller mindre grad har forbedret deres image. Det kan på sigt også have en afsmittende virkning på salg og indtjening. På nuværende tidspunkt må det dog konstateres, at godt halvdelen af virksomhederne mener, at de ikke har opnået økonomiske gevinster ved at miljømærke deres produkter: - f.eks. i form af mersalg og øget indtjening. Resultaterne viser også, at omkostningerne ved at indføre Svanen og Blomsten er forholdsvis begrænsede. Der er generelt ikke noget der tyder på, at det er omkostningsbarriererne, der afholder virksomheder fra at blive miljømærket. Sammenfattende viser undersøgelsen altså, at de fleste virksomheder i høj eller nogen grad har fået opfyldt deres mål med miljømærkningen, hvorimod de økonomiske resultater er forholdsvis begrænsede. Miljømærkning rummer en række potentialer, som kan gøre disse ordninger mere attraktive. Det stiller dog en række krav til alle involverede aktører. På baggrund af resultaterne fra undersøgelsen har vi opstillet en række anbefalinger vedrørende virksomhederne, kunderne og administratorerne af mærkningsordningerne, som vi mener kan være med til at fremme udbredelsen af miljømærkning.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Innovative firms in developing countries have the odds stacked against them in more than one way. They must contend with the objective difficulties of all sorts of capital shortages and deficient infrastructures. Highly-trained scientists, well-endowed labs, seed funding, and institutions that test and certify prototypes and protect the resulting intellectual property are few and far between in the South. They must also come to terms with global value chains in which for different reasons both multinational corporations and smaller, knowledge-intensive firms typically keep R&amp;D close to home. And finally, they are up against the broad brush of academic thought on industrial development which essentially holds that because of the technology gap between developed and developing countries, innovation proper can only really happen in the North. Thus if innovative firms appear on the radar screen at all, they are likely to register but an errant blip, the exception to the rule, that do not warrant systematic analysis. This paper analyses the absorptive capacities of automotive component suppliers in South Africa. It shows that some firms design and manufacture innovative products, while others upgrade their technological capability or merely strive to attain execution competence. It suggests that the reason for the differential performance lies in the strategic use of advanced technical skills and the kind of learning about frontier technology engendered by R&amp;D. It further discusses the ways in which foreign-owned technology is internalised more or less easily depending on whether or not it is controlled by multinational firms or by passive investors. Section 2 reviews the literature on absorptive capacities in developing countries. Section 3 discusses innovation and the technology frontier in the automotive industry, and Section 4 briefly outlines why this is relevant to firms in South Africa. Section 5 presents data and methodology. Section 6 discusses the findings. Section 7 concludes with suggestions for further research.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Keywords Supply Chain Management, Risk Management, Supply Chain Risk ManagementAbstract To comply with Supply Chain Management dogma companies have cut their inventoriesto a minimum, lead times have been shortened, new suppliers have been chosen and the customerportfolio has been reduced. All of these activities impose a great deal of risk on the firms,jeopardizing the survival of entire supply chains. In this article the author intends to investigateand document the use and meaning of Risk and Uncertainty within journals publishing material onSupply Chain Management and Logistics. Subsequently suggestions for further research areproposed - the integration of Risk Management into the discipline of Supply Chain Design.</dc:description>

Describes the conceptexternal specificity and how it's used to design supply chains. Using the concept upstream,archetypes of risk minimal and maximal design are identified. Downstream the conceptdescribes two viable scenarios, one minimizing the impact, the other minimizing theprobability of (intended) departure of a supply chain partner. Finally, principles for supplychain design are described and managerial outlined.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>It is natural to suppose that delegation and incentives are complementaryboth in the sense that when more decisions are delegated toa lower level of an organizational hierarchy, more use should be madeof incentives at that level, and in the sense that more use of incentivesshould be accompanied by more delegation. This issue is analyzedwithin a Principal-Agent framework in which there are two decisionsto be made: an effort decision which can only be made by the Agent,and some other decision which can be made by either the Principal(i.e. be centralized) or by the Agent (i.e. be delegated). Within thisframework it is shown that delegation and incentives are not necessarilycomplementary instruments; some decisions should be centralized whenincentives are introduced.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Dette working paper er en samling af case beskrivelser angående indkøbspraksisser i Danmark.Case-dataene er indsamlede i efteråret 2003 og foråret 2004. Alle beskrivelser er validerede af dedeltagende virksomheder. I den oprindelige undersøgelse var 10 virksomheder repræsenterede,men én af case-virksomhederne valgte desværre at trække sig ud af undersøgelsen på grund afmeget store ændringer i virksomhedens grundlag. Dette ændrer dog ikke det samlede billede af,at indkøbspraksisserne i virksomhederne er i opbrud. Indkøbet bliver i stadig stigende grad opfattetsom en vigtig brik til strømlining af forsyningskæden 'upstream' mod råvareleverandørerne.En egentlig case-analyse vil kunne findes i kommende publikationer af de tre forfattere.Case beskrivelserne er en vigtig del af datagrundlaget i projektet 'Indkøbspraksisser i et SCMperspektiv',der er finansieret af Center for Underleverandører i Herning. Dataene er hovedsageligtilvejebragt via interviews med indkøbsansvarlige i de pågældende case-virksomheder. I denforbindelse vil vi gerne rette en stor tak til de personer og virksomheder, der velvilligt har stilletsig til rådighed med indsigt i de processer, der strukturerer dagens indkøb.Når vi har valgt at udgive beskrivelserne i et working paper og ikke blot lade dem samle støv i enskuffe som datagrundlag for videnskabelige publikationer, er det fordi, vi håber, at beskrivelsernekan inspirere andre end os selv, eksempelvis virksomheder og nuværende og kommende studerendemed interesse i indkøbspraksisser.Nøgleord: sourcing, indkøb, underleverandører, segmentering af indkøb</dc:description>

This paper distinguishes itself from previous research done on entrepreneurialopportunities by creating a holistic and conceptual framework, which broadens and expands theperception of the market participants involved in recognition and discovery. Consequently thepaper offers insight to a diversified group of actors who mix and match technological and marketcapabilities in a constant process of recognition and discovery.Key words: Corporate venturing, entrepreneurship, discovery, networks, opportunities,recognition.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Logically it seems that companies pursuing different business strategies wouldalso manage their relationships with other firms accordingly. Nevertheless, due tothe lack of research in the field of network strategies, this link still remainsinadequately examined. Based on the well-known framework of organisationalbehaviour developed by Miles and Snow (1978), this paper argues that thepatterns of network behaviour practiced by firms greatly depend on the businesstypology of the company. That is, a company's business typology will to a certaindegree dictate the network identity of the company. In this paper evidence isprovided, that the relation between a company's strategy, structure and processesin fact have a considerable influence on its pattern of network behaviour. Threecase studies from the Danish biotech industry exemplify and illustrate how acompany's strategy is directly correlated with how it manages its strategicnetwork relations, which consequently affects its network identity (Eisenhardt1999). It is argued in this paper that the level of relational embeddedness,incentives for establishing strategic relations and the relation between the numberof non-redundant and redundant relations are the most dominant elementsdistinguishing the types of network behaviour in relation to the business typology.The paper thus strives to argue how different business typologies develop anetwork identity on the basis of their network behaviour. Due to the correlationbetween a company's strategy, structure and processes and its pattern of networkbehaviour, knowing how to manage this relation becomes essential, especiallyduring the development of new strategies.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In contemporary literature on venture capital financial infrastructures are identified as major contributors toa large proportion of today's innovations. Yet quite contradictory the literature on systems of innovation,hardly ever treat venture capitalists as a coherent actor in neither national nor regional innovation systems.In attempt to locate and determine the potentials and importance of the venture capitalists in the innovationsystem a two-dimensional taxonomy is constructed and used to illuminate their role and position. Thetaxonomy gains insights through theoretical reasoning and the possible location is exemplified by a case ofthe Danish venture capital market.It is argued in this article that venture capitalists stand a better chance of realizing their potential when theytake and are given direct and formal responsibility in the innovation system. In relation hereto, the authorsthus present initiatives to be taken to raise venture capitalists to a more direct and formal role in the contextof systems of innovation.Key words: Venture capital, innovation systems, innovation.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper reports findings from a larger study of sponsors and their relationship to sponsoredparties. In the present reporting, the focus is on sponsors. Rather than evaluating suchsponsorships in traditional effect hierarchical terms, a conceptual Sponsor Value Model isspecified as a structural equation model where the drivers are attitudes towards thesponsorship and emotions towards the sponsorship. It is found that the two classes ofvariables describe different aspects of the perception of sponsorships, and that they bothcontribute significantly to the overall value of sponsoring for a particular company. In thepresent paper, two cases are shown for two major sponsors. The specified Sponsor ValueModel is estimated by a partial least squares (PLS) method. It is found that the two sponsorsare perceived differently, both in terms of emotional and attitudinal responses. It is also foundthat the emotional responses aroused by the sponsorships are at least as important as thoseascribable to attitudinal elements.Key words: Sponsorship, emotional response, attitudes towards sponsorship, structuralequation model</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper is concerned with the measurement of emotions and the study of the role ofemotions in consumer choice. Contemporary neurological findings suggest that emotionsmay play a role in its own right, quite different from the way in which they have beenconsidered in traditional consumer choice behaviour theory. A large-scale study including800 respondents, covering 64 brands, provide findings on emotional response tendenciesfor the brands, and relate these to involvement, type of need gratification, purchasingbehaviour, etc.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Using pure single-source data, this paper provides evidence for theexistence and magnitude of long-term advertising effects across FMCG productcategories. Furthermore, we focus on the difficulties that arise for wellestablishedbrands when new products are introduced into the market andproduct innovations take place. Our research shows that such occurrencesdrastically alter the relationship between share of voice and share of market inany given FMCG market, hence making it pivotal for marketers to focus on suchrelationships in order to maintain market position.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Tourism offers an arena through which a place identity is imagined, negotiated and contained.This paper compares the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and show how these countriesconstruct and assert their identities through tourism. They both share a common history asCzechoslovakia, however, they are perceived differently by the outside world. These formerEastern Bloc countries are promoting themselves in several ways and they are alsomarginalising their socialist past and invoking their Central European identity. The Czech andSlovak search for destination identity takes into account tourists' demands and perceptions.This paper introduces the concept of the orientalist tourist gaze, and demonstrates howorientalism may manifest in tourism. Data on how these two countries are imagined werecollected in Denmark.Keywords: destination identity, host society-guest interaction, impact of tourism, orientalism</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Processing ashore of raw materials from the fisheries tend intuitively to recommend itself becausemore creation of value added in this manner should take place in Greenland. However, we observethe opposite tendency: production is shifted aboard on factory trawlers and catches are shippeddirectly to export markets or may be so after transshipping in e.g. Nuuk. It is shown that this actualdevelopment indeed is the prediction of location economics. In the case of unemployment it may beoptimal to secure raw materials for processing on plants ashore, an aim that may be achieved viasubsidies. The optimality of such policy is discussed using concepts from cost benefit analysis, andit is demonstrated how the shadow price of labor has a crucial role. Shifting to the macro levelcapacity restrictions on plants and on the labor market are pointed out. The effect of taking rawmaterial ashore is illustrated with a macro production function, which is assumed to have a positivemarginal product until the capacity limit is hit. This, however, may take place after the noninflationaryaugmenting level of employment has been reached. Finally the possibility of alternativeand better policies than the one relying on subsidies is touched upon.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper develops a conceptual model, based on a structural equation approach, forempirically investigating the role played by relational embeddedness in the process of creation ofsynergies of knowledge related capabilities in international strategic alliances. The theoreticalmodel identifies an underlying latent construct; knowledge embeddedness and its antecedents:complementarity, compatibility, tacitness, trust, protectiveness, coordination, and culturaldistance, which needs to be explicitly recognized and integrated in the theory of creation ofsynergies in international strategic alliances. While the individual importance of most of thesevariables has long been recognized in both strategic alliance and social exchange literature, theirsimultaneous effects have thus far been ignored. Embeddedness is hypothesized to be a fullmediator of these effects on creation of synergies. Furthermore, alliance longevity, absorptivecapacity, network capacity, and collaborative know-how are proposed to moderate these effects.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Although trust has been given much attention in alliance literature as an explanatory factor,little research has been devoted to defining and operationalizing trust. Trust is more or less seenas a magic ingredient, poorly understood much like the concept of luck, and usually attributed expost; successful alliances seem to involve trust; unsuccessful alliances do not. The extantliterature has treated trust as a residual term for the complex social-psychological processesnecessary for social action to occur. Since trust is a social phenomenon, both national culture andinstitutional arrangements have an impact on trust and the perception of trust. Hence, this paperdevelops a conceptual model, based on a structural equation approach, for empirically exploringthe role played by trust in the process of learning in international strategic alliances. The modeldistinguishes between pre-alliance formation factors and post-alliance formation factors in anattempt to respond to calls for research examining the evolution of trust and its impact oninternational collaborative relationships. The determinants of trust in international strategicalliances are examined and a series of testable propositions are derived to guide future empiricalinvestigation.Keywords: Trust, Strategic Alliances, Learning</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Previous empirical diversification research has largely ignored the combined effect of inputandoutput diversity as drivers of financial performance. In view of this gap, the present paperprovides an empirical analysis of the link between intraindustry commitment, diversity of thefirm's product market portfolio and performance. We suggest that commitment constrains theability to diversify, and that product market diversity can be evaluated with respect to theextent that increases in diversity lead to increases in coordination costs. Our results suggestthat commitment to physical assets and technology choice drives product and product linediversity. Furthermore, financial performance increases in product diversity and tends todecrease in the number of product lines.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The present study extends the competence-based view by appealing to cognitive frames as codeterminantsof persistent performance differentials. It is suggested that financial performance isinfluenced by a causal chain running from cognitive frames through constrained informationprocessing and perceived uncertainty. The empirical test provides evidence from survey dataand archival data supporting this assertion. We are aware of no previous work that explicitlystates or tests this causal chain. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method to estimate pathmodels when the usual approach is infeasible.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Although recent economics contributions represent important strides forward in the understanding of leadership behavior, the cognitive and symbolic dimensions of the phenomenon have attracted virtually no interests from economists and game theorists. I argue that an understanding of these dimensions may be founded on coordination games, particularly to the extent that these illustrate interactive belief formation. In this context, leadership is defined as the taking of actions that coordinate the complementary actions of many people through the creation of belief conditions that (at least) substitute for common knowledge, and where these actions characteristically consists of some act of communication directed at those being led. The concept of common knowledge (or, its approximation by means of notions of common belief) is argued to be particularly important to understanding leadership. Thus, leaders may establish common knowledge conditions, and assist the coordination of strategies in this way, or make decisions in situations where coordination problems persist in spite of common knowledge.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper develops a coordination perspective on the firm. The basic idea is to combine insights in the division of labor with insights into the allocation of property rights. Thus, a basic argument is that use rights over productive assets are necessary in order to accumulate the experience needed to perform improvements in production. Specialization in production accelerates the accumulation of skills from learning by doing in production. However, specialization introduces greater complexity and new kinds of tools and equipment and this in turn create uncertainty about the best way of coordinating the specialized and interdependent activities. The result may be bottlenecks in production and uneven development of components. Experimenting with the coordination of tasks is necessary in order to eliminate these problems. However, such experimentation is best facilitated by a certain structure of property rights. Coordination by direction provides a cheap way of conducting the experiments needed to collect information on how best to coordinate interdependent activities.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Information systems (IS) have a record of raising efficiency and effectiveness in business operations. In the modern economy, ongoing efficiency improvements through innovation play a decisive role. A new theory of distributed relations refocuses innovations comptence from core to distributed competence, raising new efficiency opportunities. The paper suggest an economic model of the efficiency op-portunities of information processing revealing the efficiency form of distributed relations, a type of efficiency recently supported by IS. Previous research suggests examples of distributed information systems that support this type of efficiency. The distributed relations type of IS leverages an efficiency approach in the context of an organizational economics approach drawing attention to organizational informatics.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Globalization of markets and new business practices are prompting high-tech firms toreconsider their competitive strategy. The increasing complexity of technologies inaddition to shorter product life cycles are also forcing firms to rely on R&amp;D as a sourceof strategy. More importantly, firms are inclined to evaluate their technologies from aportfolio's perspective in which a set or a sub-set of R&amp;D projects is evaluated together,in relation to each other. Portfolio techniques can help strategic managers in evaluatingwhether a portfolio of products is adequate from the perspective of long-term corporategrowth and profitability. Obviously, when R&amp;D projects are evaluated relative to oneanother, technical capability management of such projects must be carried outconcurrently. In this paper, R&amp;D Project Portfolio Matrix is used as a tool foranalyzing a portfolio of R&amp;D projects by linking competitive advantages of a firm tobenefits these projects may provide to customers. Examples of batteries for electricvehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) are provided to illustrate how suchmatrix is used, and what are some of the implications for innovation management ofsuch projects.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>At the beginning of the 1990s, Danish hearing aid producer, Oticon became world famous for its radical empowerment and delegation experiment, popularly called the 'spaghetti organization.' Recent work has interpreted the spaghetti experiment as a radical attempt to foster dynamic capabilities by imposing structural ambiguity on the organization (Lovas and Ghoshal 2000; Verona and Ravasi 1999; Ravasi and Verona 2000). However, this work has neglected that about a decade later, many of the more radical elements of the spaghetti organization have been left. This paper presents an organizational economics interpretation of the spaghetti organization and its subsequent transformation. In such an interpretation, the spaghetti organization imposed significant organizational costs that could be tolerated as long as the benefits produced by the spaghetti organization dominated the costs. One source of organizational costs that the paper focuses on turn on the potential contradiction involved in combining a strong manager who possesses ultimate decision rights with widespread delegation. Apparently, Oticon management failed to solve, or didn't even realize the nature of, the resulting commitment problem. A number of implications are developed, particularly with respect to the firm-market dichotomy.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Until recently, the transfer of professional teamplayers between European clubsplaced limits on the operations of a free market in that there were rules restricting theterms placed on such transfers. However, the ruling of the European Court of Justicein December 1995 in the `Bosman case' declared that such arrangements were contraryto the provisions of article 48 of the EEC treaty. The effects of the ruling -a redistributionof property rights from the clubs to the players- induced an increase of averageplayer salaries and longer contract duration. Using data from the National BasketballAssociation (NBA) the paper discusses a highly similar reallocation of propertyrights in North America and tests empirically the -so far- inconclusive question, ifremuneration and contract-length are complementary or substitutes.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The present article introduces the theory of cultural evolution as a possible basis for furtherdevelopment of a micro-evolutionary economic theory. Cultural evolution is Lamarckian andinvolves social transmission of explicit knowledge by choice or imposition. A possiblecomplementary Darwinian principle operating in the social realm is defined in terms of socialtransmission of tacit knowledge. According to this principle, termed Local EmulativeSelection, some forms of tacit knowledge are not adapted (those which cannot be reached byconsciousness) by their carrier. I then identify a problem of adaptation that plagues any formof Lamarckian selection. This base-line problem implies that the evolutionary potentialdecreases as the possibility of adaptation increases. In consequence, the social transmissionof tacit knowledge, which cannot be reached by consciousness, protects the evolutionarypotential associated with any form of social evolution. By contrast, it is suggested that asystematic codification of tacit knowledge can potentially corrupt the evolutionary potentialof any organisation.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This article examines the effect of variation - in the geographical operations - of international business operations on experiential knowledge development in the internationalization of the firm. Based on learning theory, this article develops five hypotheses on the effects of variation on three interrelated components of international experiential knowledge: internationalization knowledge, business knowledge and institutional knowledge. The LISREL analysis indicates that variation has a positive effect on the accumulation of experiential knowledge in internationalizing firms. In particular, it demonstrates that internationalization knowledge is a key variable which mediates the effect of variation on the other two knowledge variables.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Lovas and Ghoshal (2000) developed the notion of `strategy as guided evolution,' using the case of Oticon A/S. This note points out that the radical `spaghetti' organization described by Lovas and Ghoshal has been partially abandoned in Oticon. Developing an organizational economics interpretation of this episode, the present note argues that there are important implications for the understanding of the conditions under which internal hybrids may be viable and contribute to competitive advantage. The main focus in on the managerial commitment problem. Testable propositions are derived.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The possible convergence of international systems of corporate governance has become the topic of a lively debate. In opposition to the political theory (Roe 1991, 1994), Gilson (2000) and Coffee (1999) have persuasively argued that although little formal convergence may be taking place in ownership and board structure, corporate behaviour seems to be converging in a functional sense. This paper reviews Coffees argument and some of the ensuing debate emphasising internationalisation of equity markets as the powerful driving force behind convergence. But while the debate has focused rather narrowly on convergence of European governance to American standards, I argue that US corporate governance has also converged to European standards: insider ownership and managerial incentives have increased; outside board members, independent subcommittees and chairmen have become more common and the banking system has been deregulated to allow banks to play a more active governance role.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper builds on existing empirical research on knowledge transfer and sharing in inter-firmand intra-firm networks, for constructing a comparative framework. The first comparative questionaddressed is: what types of organizational network can govern what types of knowledge network?Both the cognitive difficulty of communication and the incentive to give information turn out to befundamental in finding an answer. The variables influencing those two dimensions are discussed (divergence in knowledge and preference, computational and epistemic complexity). The secondcomparative question is what the differences are between intra-firm and interfirm knowledge flowsand knowledge governance mechanisms. The results of our analysis downplay the exclusiveproperties of firms in knowledge transfer/sharing respects hypothesised by the `knowledge-basedtheory of the firm', and call for a more `continuous' (rather than `discrete') and `combinatorial'(rather than `idealtipical') notion of governance mechanisms and forms.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We assess the argument that corporate acquisitions are driven mainly by agencyconsiderations. This argument holds that certain kinds of mergers&amp;mdash;mergers between firms inunrelated industries, mergers between firms with large differences in price-earnings ratios, andmergers financed with stock swaps, for example&amp;mdash;will consistently fail, eventually being reversedin a divestiture. Appealing to Mises's theory of entrepreneurship, we argue instead thatdivestitures of previously acquired assets usually result from experimentation and learning,healthy attributes of a market economy. We then describe empirical evidence that the long-termsuccess or failure of corporate acquisitions cannot, in general, be predicted by measures ofagency conflicts. We also show that mistaken acquisitions are more likely under certain circumstances,namely during periods of intense, industry-specific regulatory activity. This is consistentwith the view, expressed repeatedly in the Austrian literature, that entrepreneurial error is associatedwith government intervention&amp;mdash;in particular, with government ownership of property andinterference with the price system.JEL Classifications: D84, G34, G38Key words: acquisitions, divestitures, entrepreneurship, market process, experimentation</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The impact of modular products on the organization of product development has recently attracted interest in academia. This paper explores the economic rational behind the idea that modular products result in modular product organizations using a team-theoretic approach. An important implication that can be drawn from team theory is that the nature of the design problem and the way in which it can efficiently be decomposed into design tasks strongly influence the information structures of organizations and therefore also the extent to which the organization can be characterized as a modular organization. Different economic rationales behind task definitions are identified and discussed. The organization of product development activities also can be expected to vary with the main goal of the product development team. I argue that when the minimization of lead-time is the main goal one should expect to find a more modular product development organization among firms that follow a modular product development strategy compared to those that follow an integral product development strategy.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We argue that the property rights perspective, as developed by economists such as Coase, Alchian, Demsetz and Barzel, is uniquely positioned to inform and further the understanding of competitive strategy. This is because of its consistent focus on the capture and protection of property rights as a main explanatory principle; a principle that we argue may also be usefully applied to the study of firm strategy. In our view, all firms trade resources spent on capture and protection off against value creation. Strategizing concerns changing the tradeoff to the advantage of the firm by identifying and influencing impediments to value creation. We use these insights to derive a number of refutable propositions, and argue that key insights from both industrial organization economics and the resource-based view are consistent with the property rights perspective.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Recent theoretical and empirical analysis in the field of economic organisation hasfocussed almost exclusively on identifying organisational practices and complementaritiesbetween such practices, invariant to the type of activity in question. However, this paper takesits point of departure in the observation from organisational theory that more knowledgeintensiveproduction activities often involve higher degrees of strategic uncertainty for firms andperformance ambiguity in relation to individual employees. Therefore, the `organic' or `clan'form of organisation &amp;mdash; involving the application of `new' HRM practices &amp;mdash; is expected toyield a higher outcome in terms of performance within knowledge-intensive sectors of theeconomy, as compared to other sectors. Moreover, knowledge-intensive activities are likely torequire the utilisation of local knowledge to a higher degree than less knowledge-intensiveactivities. Given that the application of new HRM practices is one way of supporting such localknowledge, it should also for this reason be expected that the application of HRM practices aremore effective for knowledge-intensive production activities. A sample of 726 Danish firms withmore than 50 employees in manufacturing and private services is applied. The results show thatHRM practices are more effective in influencing innovation performance when applied together,rather than when applied alone. In other words, organisational complementarities obtain.Moreover, it is shown that the application of (complementary) HRM practices is more effectivein what is normally perceived to be more knowledge-intensive sectors as compared to lessknowledge-intensive sectors.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Knowledge management is rarely found in a strategy context. Although some companiesalready have introduced the role of a chief knowledge officer, knowledge management is nottreated as a strategic endeavour. Furthermore, contributions from an academic point of vieware scarce in the field of the strategic issues of knowledge management. This papercontributes with some insight in pointing out the strategic question that knowledgemanagement might provide answers for: The efficiency issue of stategic positioning.Furthermore, the paper emphasises the distinction between symmetric and asymmetricincentives in business relations, and on this basis identifies the notion of DistributedKnowledge Management as a means for creating efficiency strategies with symmetricincentives in business relations. In this way a strategic agenda for knowledge management isidentified.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>I critically discuss a number of recent and increasingly influential claims about economic organization in the `knowledge economy.' The relevant claims are that traditional authority relations will tend to disappear, the boundaries of the firm will blur, and coordination mechanisms will be very malleable (resulting in various `new organizational forms'). In order to get an analytical focus on the knowledge economy, I assume that it may be approximated by `Hayekian settings' (after Hayek 1945), that is, settings in which knowledge is distributed and where knowledge inputs are relatively more important in production than physical capital inputs. I then argue, drawing on organizational economics as well as Mises' insights in property rights and comparative systems, that the presence of Hayekian settings does not mean that authority will disappear, etc. Thus, Misesian insights help to resurrect the Coasian firm against attacks inspired by Hayek's writings on knowledge.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Hybrid governance forms that seek to meld the virtues of both market control and traditional hierarchical control are alluring. While extensive research has examined such hybrids forms, the research has been restricted largely to external hybrids --- market exchanges infused with elements of hierarchical control. Comparatively little research, outside of the M-form literature, has examined internal hybrids --- hierarchical forms infused with elements of market control. This paper contends that common change initiatives, such as TQM, reengineering, autonomous work teams, and group-based rewards, are appropriately viewed as attempts to craft internal hybrids by selectively infusing elements of market control within hierarchy. However, these common change initiatives are implemented commonly in isolation and, as a consequence, violate patterns of complementarity that both sustain traditional hierarchy or support the stable infusion of market control. Managers overlay new measures on existing, functionally-oriented structures; they implement new structures without new performance measures and without new pay systems; they implement new pay systems, but fail to restructure or develop new performance measures. The paper argues that these violations of complementarity often trigger the unraveling of the bundle of elements that support traditional hierarchy and spiral hierarchies toward fundamental transformation. The clear trajectory of these transformations is toward quite radically, disaggregated organizations structured around teams. The paper presents both logic and evidence supporting the existence of complementarities among these common change initiatives.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Efficiency arguments explain why commercial intermediaries exist and will continue to be involved in the exchanges despite the spread of digital networks. Commercial intermediaries provide producers and consumers with a set of information, logistic, securization and insurance (and liquidity) services. By bundling these services and by dedicating assets and learning capabilities to their production, commercial intermediaries enable to economize on transaction costs. Digital network per se cannot enables transacting parties to benefit from such efficient providers of intermediation services. Rather than establishing direct relationships among producers and consumers, the Internet will support a re-organization of existing intermediation chains, because traditional intermediaries will reinforce their ability to provide these service by using ITs. The analysis of the role of commercial intermediaries thus leads to a better understanding of the futures of e-Commerce. In turn, e-Commerce provides New-Institutional Economics with a stimulating case to analyze the economics of commercial intermediation.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>How does population dynamics influence outcomes in situations with public goodcharacteristics? The present paper answers this question by analysing the evolution of costlycooperation in a multi-group population. Building on insights first developed in modernbiology the idea of viscous population equilibria is introduced (a population is said to beviscous when a (sub)population of players is spatially or genetically clustered). A simplemodel then analyses how the combined effect of viscosity within multiple subgroups anddifferent levels of between-group segregation influences the evolution of cooperation. Theresults suggest that a key issue in the evolution of cooperation is the shifting balance betweenthe need to protect cooperators and propagation of the tendency to cooperate.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The purpose of the present article is to contribute to a more detailed understanding of thedeterminants of the firm's environmental performance. We pursue this aim by formulating aschematic theoretical model including a number of antecedents, mediators and consequencesthat are important according to the literature on environmental management and corporategreening. In addition, the model includes market orientation and the firm's level ofinternationalization as possible determinants of environmental performance. Unfortunately,the previous empirical research on environmental management and corporate greening has notyet developed the measures needed to achieve a reasonable level of construct validity. To fillthis gap, we complement previous research by developing and refining the multi-item scalesnecessary to measure the constructs of our theoretical model. We use a series of nestedcovariance structure models to test our theoretical model on survey data from 1995 and 1999.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Under conditions of pervasive uncertainty, increasing the `amount' of information will notnecessarily decrease uncertainty. Perhaps more information will even increase uncertainty.Since information may be valuable, even under conditions of pervasive uncertainty, thisamounts to a puzzle. Its solution seems to hold the promise of understanding how decisionmakersactually go about reducing uncertainty in its more pervasive forms and is therefore atthe center of attention in the present article. It is hypothesized that the role of routines indecision-making provides the key to solve the `information puzzle.' Drawing on data from 56companies, the argument is supported by empirical tests employing path analysis by linearstructural equations modeling.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We develop a view of the MNC as a knowledge-creating and and utilizing entity, building on the extant literature on the differentiated MNC as well as on Lyles and Schwenk's work on corporate knowledge structures. The starting point for this conceptualization is that MNC management through choices regarding organizational control, motivation and context can influence the development, characteristics and transfer of knowledge. This extends existing literature. For example, in most of the literature, the characteristics of knowledge are seen as exogenous rather than endogenous variables. However, to the extent that management chooses a specific way of sourcing knowledge, it also implicitly chooses the characteristics of the sourced knowledge and the ease with which it can be transferred inside the MNC. This is because knowledge from different knowledge sources have different characteristics and are thus transferred at different cost. The six hypotheses that we draw from the main argument are tested on the basis of a unique and very rich dataset on subsidiary knowledge development (including information on the organizational setting, sources of subsidiary knowledge and the extent of knowledge transfer to other MNC-units) that has been constructed in connection with a cross-national project Centres of Excellence (Holm and Pedersen 2000a). The dataset covers more than 2.000 subsidiaries located in seven different European countries. 1</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Empirical research has made progress in developing indicators for the measurement oftechnological competences. A so far unmet challenge, however, is to trace the patterns ofrelationships among key variables at the firm level as they unfold in the context of theindustry dynamics. The aim of the present paper is therefore to develop the methodologyrequired to search for patterns of relationships among such key variables (R&amp;D investments,technology and performance), to trace these patterns over time and thereby unfold theunderlying industry dynamics. We are here referring to the possibility of using statisticalmethods such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to trace similarities and dissimilaritiesamong a set of variables - as opposed to testing simple linear and non-linear causal relations.We extend the previous use of MDS to further include what is known as "external unfolding."Using this proposed methodology, we derive an "industry space" that allows identification ofthe tendency to form groups, and to infer the stability of such groups of firms sharing similarconditions.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Requisite variety has influenced concepts of environmental relations of organizationfor almost half a century. This article develops the concept of `requisite foresight'on the basis of its roots in cybernetics and extends its applicability to contemporaryknowledge management. Organization theory incorporating a temporal aspectand reaching for `requisite foresight' challenges a dualistic and rigid interpretation oforganizational environment. If considered within a network of organizations `distributedknowledge' paves the way for `requisite foresight'. A `foresight' approach explainsprevalent perspectives in new e-business applications, like supply chain managementand customer relationship management. Concluding, `requisite foresight'merges strands of reasoning useful to the expansion of organizational models in theknowledge economy.</dc:description>

					<dc:title>The Inadequacy of specificity and role of importance in explaining</dc:title>

					<dc:description>It is argued that specificity is inadequate to explain hold-up, as the definition is imprecise as to which party incurs a loss if an asset is redeployed. If both parties to a transaction incur a loss when an asset is redeployed, neither party can credibly hold up the other party. Also the concept does not address expectations. It is the expected loss (not the actual loss) of parties that will drive attempts at hold-up. Therefore focusing on specificity when talking hold-up can be misleading. As a consequence the concept of importance is introduced. The importance of an asset to a firm is the expected loss to the firm if access to the asset is lost. Various determinants of importance are discussed by using a formal framework. Implications are forwarded, and it is argued that the relative importance of the parties has to change for hold-up to occur. One-sided specific investments inherently lead to mutual importance, which mitigates hold-up. Situations without specificity can lead to hold-up if expectations are asymmetric. Lastly, hold-up does not imply a hold-up problem.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract We analyze a key problem in organization theory and design, namely the potential tension between authority (i.e., the power to make decisions which guide the decisions of another person) and the discretion of employees (i.e., the ability ofagent to control resources including his own human capital). The problem is rootedthe fact that in organizations, decisions rights are always loaned rather than owned;hierarchical superior can always in principle overrule a hierarchical inferior. We provide an integrative treatment of the tensions that are involved in the interaction between authority and discretion, and the motivational problems that may result from this tension. We discuss how these problems may be checked by credible managerial commitments and other mechanisms. The framework is then applied to an analysisnew organizational forms, specifically internal hybrids. Thus, the framework addsthe understanding of the costs and benefits of alternative organizational forms.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This empirical study addresses the question of how foreign market unfamiliarity of entrant firms develops post-entry. Three different predictions of post-entry change of foreign market unfamiliarity are derived from the literature on firms' internationalization process. The predictions are made subject to empirical examination using a set of primary data of current (i.e. at the point in time of mail interviews) foreign operation business operations reported by managers of Danish international firms. The empirical study gives insight to the incidence and character of the so-called `shock effect' in relation to foreign market entry: the phenomenon of entrant firms' inclination to underestimate differences between the home and host country in terms of the business environment. The data support the supposition that entrant firms in general are exposed to a `shock effect'. On average, the foreign market unfamiliarity as perceived by the entrant firms peaks seven years after entry. The company data indicate that entrant firms in general experience the shock effect in relation to entry of adjacent, rather than distant, countries. Hence, the `psychic distance paradox' hypothesis is supported. Also, the data suggest that the shock effect befalls producers of customized products, but not producers of standardized products, and furthermore, entrant firms in general experience the shock effect in relation to acquisition of tacit rather than explicit knowledge. Key words: Internationalization process of firms, liability of foreignness, learning, shock effect.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The famous three chapters in Nelson and Winter (1982) that focus on firm routines and capabilities are often taken to be solidly founded on an assumption of bounded rationality. I argue that, in actuality, bounded rationality plays a rather limited role in Nelson and Winter (1982), that the very different assumption of tacit knowledge is much more central, and that the links between bounded rationality and routines/capabilities are not clear. I then argue that the absence in Nelson and Winter of a clear methodological individualist foundation for notions such as routines, capabilities, competencies, etc. have resulted in certain explanatory difficulties in the modern organizational capabilities approach that has taken so much inspiration from their work.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The present article introduces Development, a new, unpublished and hitherto unknown articlewritten by Joseph A. Schumpeter. It was originally written in 1932 and titled Entwicklung.Development is remarkable since it helps understand the unity of Schumpeter's work andsignificantly adds to Schumpeter's known works on a number of issues that were central to histheory of economic development. Development shows that Schumpeter considered the explanationof novelty as the most important unsolved scientific problem. For Schumpeter, entrepreneurshipremained a good description of novelty, but, by his own admission in Development, nothing isexplained thereby. On the optimistic side, Schumpeter indicates that theoretical advances might beforthcoming that can help a better understanding of the social dynamics which gives rise to novelty.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The relationship and network literature has primarily focused on particular partner types e.g. buyer-supplierrelationships or competitor interaction. This paper explores the relative importance of different internationalrelationships for New Product Development processes. The paper is based on the KNOW survey1, whichwas carried out in 2000 in seven European countries. The analyses highlight two apparently contradictoryfindings, first, that relationships with customers are used most frequently at both early and late stages of theproduct development process, and second, that customer relationships, at the same time, have a negativeimpact on innovative success. Moreover, the type of knowledge exchanged in the relationship can be eithercomplementary or supplementary in nature and the present analysis points to the importance ofsupplementary knowledge for innovative success.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In light of the under-explored potential of Simon's theory of altruism, the purpose of thepresent article is to review his explanation of altruism and to point out some of itsimplications for behavioural economics and theories of economic organization. In the courseof the argument, this article relates Simon's theory of altruism to Hamilton's theory ofkinship selection and then proceeds to examine a critical assumption of Simon's model thatsocial organizations know better than individuals. Within the parameters of Simon's ownmodel, the paper suggests how this assumption can be justified. The paper concludes bynoting that Simon offered a new and so far under-explored mechanism for the emergence ofaltruism in biological populations and suggests a controlled experiment to test Simon'sexplanation against Hamilton's. Finally, it is noteworthy that Simon's theory has immediateimplications for the understanding of human nature that invites revision and development ofbehavioural economics and theories of economic organization.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The recent decade's research on organizational forms has gained important headway in convergingupon a few particularly important causes of the new forms that have been observed.Yet, most studies offer no explicit definition of `organizational form,' and ignore the need toestablish what should count as a `new form.' In order to advance this research, the presentpaper therefore aims to provide a preliminary definition of organizational form, developedalong the lines of organizational economics. A typology is provided that allows identificationof alternative forms of organizing in terms of distinct architectures (topology plus dynamicrules) and a corresponding level of delegation of decision rights.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The objective of this paper is to contribute to understanding knowledge integration. Theguiding question is 'What are the mechanisms underlying knowledge integration?' Byknowledge integration we mean solving the problem raised by specialization: Specializationleads to a dispersion of specialized bodies of knowledge that are held by different specialists.Knowledge integration refers to how this drawing on different bodies of specializedknowledge is organized. The paper is organized in three main parts. First, we analyze whatthe problem of knowledge integration consists in, how it can be approached, and whatmechanisms are underlying the approaches. Subsequently, we supply an empirical and aconceptual anchoring to our understanding. Finally, we propose to answer the question how touse such an understanding in analysing knowledge integration by focussing the analysis oncommunities of practice as the most adapted level of analysis for analysing knowledgeintegration, and on 'recurrent interaction patterns' within and between such communities. Sucha focus would centure on one of the most important mechanisms for providing knowledgeintegration, it would be on a solid conceptual grounding, and it also is a practical approachthat can be implemented.Keywords: knowledge flows, knowledge integration, communities of practice, recurrentinteraction patterns, routines</dc:description>

Since then, the concept of routineshas been taken up widely in the economics and business literature. Many ambiguities andopen questions still persist, however. The article presents a review of the literature on routines(mainly) since 1982, focussing on the questions 'What progress has been made inunderstanding what routines are', and 'what are their roles in organisations and in theeconomy?'</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Discrete choice experiments are widely used in relation to healthcare. A stream of recent literature therefore aims at testing the validityof the underlying preference axioms of completeness and transitivity,and detecting other preference phenomena such as unstability, learn-ing/tiredness effects, ordering effects, dominance, etc. Unfortunatelythere seems to be some confusion about what is actually being tested,and the link between the statistical tests performed and the relevantunderlying model of respondent behaviour has not been explored inthis literature. The present paper tries to clarify the notions involvedand discuss what can be tested in a general frequency of choice frame-work and more specifically in a random utility model.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper is based on an explorative case study of all.department e-mails that were sent on the Intranet of a Danish university department. Following a social constructionist approach, our analysis assumes that language use shapes relations, identities, and representations. We thus investigate which social relations are expressed and constructed in the e-mail discourse and how the organizational world of the department is represented in the all.department e-mails. Our analyses of the e-mails show that the managerial voices are dominant as well as the perception of e-mail communication as a tool of information transmission. However, a few e-mails sent by employees without specific organizational functions differ significantly from the `managerial' mails. In these mails employee voices articulate a latent and unfulfilled need for a community and a forum for dialogue. The usage of the all.department e-mail communication is also related to the ongoing change of managing university departments in Denmark.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>An unintended outcome of transition is the emergence of new forms of governance.Stakeholders other than shareholders influence corporate management to a higher degree thanin mature market economies. Employees gained influence through ownership stakes or workcouncils, while elsewhere investment funds or governmental authorities retain influence viaequity stakes or otherwise. This paper reviews privatisation and the newly created forms ofprivate ownership to document the evolution of stakeholder capitalism and to discuss theopportunities and dangers that it may create for businesses in the region.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The internal scientific evaluation of knowledge claims done by peer review is todayhas for the last20 years been supplemented by new methods of knowledge assessment. These methods are usuallytaken from other sectors such as the public administration and the corporate sector. Because of theirdifferent backgrounds compared to the peer review method, it is necessary to critically examinethem in relation to assessment of quality. But this also calls for a new understanding of science andknowledge. The article starts by briefly explaining this new understanding, before going into moredetails on the new methods of knowledge assessment and the perspectives behind them.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Over the past decade, European businesses have accelerated internationalization, expanding within and beyond Europe. I argue that a major driving force behind this push towards global presence is the restructuring of corporate diversification strategies, which in turn is a result of gradual changes in industry structure and the institutional environment in home markets as well as global markets. The strategic change converts diversified conglomerates to global specialists in narrower niche markets. It brings them in direct confrontation with a small number of key competitors operating worldwide. On this stage, key competitive advantages are gained by making best use of resources across the world, and by effective global integration of operations. Hence de-diversification and internationalization are opposite sides of the same coin: globalfocusing. The argument is developed based on inductive case research of the restructuring in two Danish manufacturing enterprises, and a review of overall trends in Danish businesses. On this basis, I analyze the economic and institutional forces driving this process, and suggest propositions for empirical testing. The paper points to consequences of liberalization, and is thus of high relevance for managers and policy makers in countries that are not yet as open as Denmark.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In various ways, this paper makes the counter-intuitive claim that the utopian and the material are thoroughlyinterdependent, rather than worlds apart. First, through a reading of Thomas More's Utopia, it is argued thatUtopia is the product of particular kinds of relations, rather than merely a detachment from the known world.Second, the utopianism of a new economy firm is examined. It is argued that the physical set-up of the firm -in particular the distribution of tables and chairs - evoke a number of alternatives to ordinary work practice.In this way the materialities of the firm are crucial to its persuasive image of being the office of the future.The notion that utopia is achieved through material arrangements is finally related to the analysis of facts andfictions in ANT. It is argued, that even though Utopias are neither fact nor fiction, they are both material andeffective on the configuration of networks; Where facts tend to stabilise the network by `holding' others,Utopias tend to `push' the network by evoking the possibility of others.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>IT-enabled innovations are of increasing importance for competitive success in most sectors today. This paper offers a novel theoretical and empirically illustrated explanation of why IT-outsourcing strategies differ between innovative first-movers, fast followers and late entrants. In particular, an analysis of three companies in the financial sector - Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investment, and Merrill Lynch - reveals that governance choices influence a company's ap-propriable learning curve advantage to slow down or speed up adoption and imitation of IT-enabled innovation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of governance choices in techno-logical environments characterised by either accumulation or disruption.

					<dc:description>This working paper presents the first results of a close collaboration between theHCI-Research Group, at the Department of Informatics, CBS and the LundbeckInstitute. KA-CHE is the abbreviation chosen as current project name for the elearningproject between the two partners. The name can be seen as dealing with twoperspectives:Knowledge Acquisition in1) Continuing Healthcare Education - Lundbeck Institute perspective.2) Computer Human Environments - HCI-Research Group perspective.This report contains the resulting descriptions of analyses, investigations andevaluations carried out in the pre-phase by the HCI-Research Group, who has takenup the part as project leaders of the pre-phase and authors of the working paper1.However, the work carried out within the pre-phase has taken a co-operativeapproach between the two partners.This working paper has a rather applied format, where the study of and with theLundbeck Institute, human computer interaction issues as well as the first designideas are disseminated. As such the report does not provide a thorough frame ofreferences within the HCI-area (Human Computer Interaction) and e-learning area,as these are seen as implicit for the understanding of the empirical study. Rather highemphasis has been given to the analysis, interpretation and argumentation based onthe empirical study. The working paper can be seen as an inspirational work forresearchers and practitioners in similar projects in the same preliminary phase.Below follows a description of the work process in the pre-phase and among thepartners, also clarifying how we found the focus areas of the pre-phase, known as theproject map (in section 1.1). The next chapter (chapter 0) provides a detailed accountof the pre-phase project results, taking a holistic view to the e-learning project,envisioning the potential scenarios, possibilities and barriers, the user group andsetting out the scene for the decisions and actions to come.The following chapters present the basic themes and the analysis that constitute thefoundation for the results in chapter 0. As such chapter 3 provides the more internallook at the Lundbeck Institute, investigating the current activities, the lessons learnedwithin Continuing Medical Education (CME), the visions of e-learning and thepeople it is targeted at. Chapter 4 and 5 provides the more external perspectivesbeing based on investigations of learning models and pedagogical tools, LearningManagement Systems (LMS), Continuing Medical Education (CME) andAccreditation considerations. The computer human interactions perspective inchapter 6 provides again a more internal aspect concerning the resources andresearch potentials within the HCI-Research Group, at the same pointing to areasthat are essential for the continuation and success of the KA-CHE project for theLundbeck Institute. The reader should thus see chapter 2 as the resulting HCI interpretations and design considerations of the preliminary analysis described in thefollowing chapters.The working paper is written considering both the current and future context of theLundbeck Institute and what we know and need to know more about with respect tothe future users of the e-learning activities. Another of our concern has been toinvestigate the Lundbeck Institute current activities and raise questions that theInstitute needs to consider when contemplating a relatively large e-learning project.However, we find that the concepts investigated and the processes we have beenthrough have a general relevance. We are thus grateful to the Lundbeck Institute forallowing publication of these pre-phase results.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper addresses the innovation activities of automotive component manufacturers in South Africa. It looks at the technological trajectory of a handful of firms that stand out from the crowd and analyses the results of their endeavours in the context of their interaction with foreign capital, their internal upgrading and R&amp;D agenda, and their interface with South Africa's national innovation system (NIS). The analysis makes use of eight case studies, and illustrates the conditions under which indigenous innovation in the automotive industries can happen in a developing country. This finding contradicts at least part of the conventional wisdom concerning the location of innovation activities in global car value chains. Results also point to a deficient NIS insofar as there appears to be a disjuncture between the demand for engineering competence in the manufacturing sector on the one hand and output from the tertiary education sector on the other. Open questions that need further attention include among others the overall functioning of the NIS, and changes over time in the perception of local innovation potential by car assemblers.Keywords: automotive industry, developing countries, technology transfer, technology accumulation, innovation.JEL Classification: L62, O31, O32.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The 1990s have been a period of extraordinary politics in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). This chapter discusses how the transition from state to market has created bureaucratic barriers to entry, but also windows of opportunity for foreign direct investment (FDI). The high costs and high investment risks associated with FDI in CEE are a reflection the institutional development. Thus, inflows of FDI have been largest in those countries that made most progress in establishing a market-oriented institutional framework. After outlining trends of institutional change and their impact on FDI, this chapter discusses how aspects of the institutional framework and FDI policy affect diverse types of investment projects. Acquisition and Greenfield investors are concerned with different aspects of government policy: privatization and regulatory policies for acquirers and investment incentives, regional policy and special economic zones for Greenfield investors. The shifting policy priorities have thus changed the types of projects undertaken by foreign investors in the region.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper has two distinct aims. First, I would like to present and discuss the nationalbusiness systems (NBS) framework ( Whitley, 1992,1992a,1996,1997). NBS frameworkconcerns how national variations in economic co-ordination and control systemsfacilitate and constrain organisational change. The NBS is not widely known in the LatinAmerica countries, and this paper intends to shortly present it The second aim is toquestion, based on the NBS approach, some of the assumptions about the diffusion of anew universal template for organising work (Lean Production) and its agent, themultinational corporation.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In this paper, I discuss how a theoretical framework can be build to analyse socialprocesses of transformation, making the link between macro and micro processes, inwhich this dichotomy can be overcome. The aim of this theoretical framework is toaccount for the transformation in societal characteristics and changes in actors' strategiesat micro level, in a way that links macro changes and micro processes - the cognitivestructures of the individual and social structures of the society. In order to build this framework, I draw from the figuration sociology of Norbert Elias, the praxeologia ofPierre Bourdieu and the work of Michael Crozier.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Initiatives in medical practice that are saidto re-insert the subject, thereby overcomingthe problems of objectifying practices inearlier times, often operate with a notion ofbodies and selves as pre-establishedentities. In this paper, I will try to showsome of the work it takes to produce orperform self-monitoring subjects whoparticipate in keeping their asthmaticbodies in control through the use of anonline control center. I argue that the bodiesin control and the competent selves relatedto this technology depend on theestablishment of a chronically ill body andon the decentering and incorporation of theclinic in everyday life. Passages into thebody are to be kept open in real-timethrough the involvement of materiallyheterogeneous arrangements.The distributed character of this workcreates and is dependent on an ambiguity inrelation to the question of agency. Who orwhat acts, decides, looks, knows and so on,is not necessarily defined or otherwise clearin the day-to-day use of the technology.Instead, agency becomes performed inparticular instances, where it might becomethe property of one part of the network oranother. Creating the asthmatic as a free,autonomous agent in this instance dependson blurring other nodes in the network inthe day-to-day use of this technology, thesebeing, the physician, the technology, andthe scientific set-up. As such, I argue thatagency in the form of the self-monitoringcompetent ill, is best understood as asuccessful performance of invisiblepassages and links that hook up bodies,other selves, science and medical practices.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Corporate venturing managers have the rule of thumb that only approximately one out often investments really pay of in financial measures. These low odds for success, of course,put extremely high expectations to the profit yielded from the few investments that becomesuccessful. In other words, the few successful investments carry the costs of many moreinvestment decisions. It would obviously be attractive to improve the ability to `pick thewinners'. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for understanding how firms`involvement in establishing and nurturing the venture base (the idea creation phase)enhances their ability to select ventures.Keywords: Corporate venturing, venture base, selection, network.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The aim of this work is to conduct a theoretical and empirical investigation of how the marketinstitution performs in the context of technology and knowledge transfer. The notion of politicalmarkets, first introduced by Adam Smith, is extended to the artifacts of technology and theirassociated factor markets. The paper develops the notion of political markets by drawing upon anempirical case that reconstructs the chain of events related to the transfer of flexible manufacturingsystems (FMS). The case account for the various actors and institutions involved in the technologytransfer, including the firms on both sides of the market, the government, the engineering-scientists,the economists, the union representatives and the machinists.It is argued that Natural markets is a special case of political markets in which technologies andhybrid entities and identities produce both the Natural market as well as its master - the puretechnological relations. Neither the Natural market, nor Homo economicus can be brought intoexistence without pure technological relations. The existence of the latter is a necessary conditionfor the existence of the two former, as has already been recognized by neoclassical economics. Thepresent work makes a constructive contribution to neoclassical economics in this respect, bydescribing and analyzing all the work of purification that enters into the task of bringing thenecessary conditions into existence. Indeed, the process of purification that brings purified3technologies, natural markets and rational identities like homo economicus into existence, requirehuge investments, as do their maintenance. Technical knowledge turned out to be no exception. Asthe case suggests, technical knowledge was not just a given condition, but became a producedoutcome. Yet, the process of knowledge production continued, transforming given technicalknowledge in unexpected ways. Technical knowledge also became a negotiated outcome during thetransfer of FMS. Hence, when market transaction takes place, knowledge it self can be transformed,and with it, the conditions for conducting the market transaction. So, the notion of political marketsproposed here, suggests that knowledge can be both premises as well as an outcome of markettransaction - as knowledge, its status and distribution - can be negotiated in the process.Instead of criticizing Homo economicus and (neo) classical economics, the notion of politicalmarkets thus proposed imply a constructive contribution to economics, notably to the core of neoclassical economics:Through out this paper, it is argued with reference to both theory and own empirical fieldwork, thatneoclassical economics participate in the successful purification of technological relations. Yet, inorder to provide for an explanation of such a successful outcome, it is not enough to account foreconomists among themselves. As has already been suggested by Callon (1998) and the associatedwork on the anthropology of markets, also such material associations as computer basedcalculations and simulations of the macro-economy must be brought into the explanation. In morespecific terms, the puzzling `residual' in the neoclassical production function can be explained bynow also taking into account the many subtle ways economics itself interfere in making up theresidual. Neoclassical economics only have to refine their production function by adding to it thesignificance of material associations such as computer based calculations and simulations of themacro-economy. Done properly, a revised macro-economic model would emerge, capable ofhandling `market failures' in new ways. Instead of attributing all failures to the market and nofailures to technology, a more symmetric distribution of failures between the two entities would beallowed for. Further more, each time a `residual' emerges from applying the revised model, it is nolonger simply due to `technical change' but also due to `market failures'. Hence, such a revisedmacro-economic model not only allow neoclassical economics to maintain the distincti</dc:description>

					<dc:description>There is a continuing focus on the conditions for and processes of establishing new businesses andthe role played by the external resource context in doing so. Using sociological concepts such asnetwork bricolage and structuration some studies point to the supporting role as well as therestraining role of networks in this process. However, most research focuses on the innovative roleof entrepreneurs in linking together dispersed resources in forming a concerted business enterprise.Far less focus has been on the de facto quality of these resources in forming the entrepreneurial role.Rather, the image of the Knightian or Kriznian entreprenur is left unchallenged, even in the `new'literature on entrepreneurship. However, if the concept of network bricolage or structuration ascontexts institutionalising specific practices and sorting away others is taken seriously, the preexistenceof patterned work practices shared among business actors, and how the ability to utilisethese patterned practices in generating new business ideas affects the business start up processbecomes important. Entrepreneurial processes may not only be influenced but also internallyconstituted by the wider environment. One may therefore question whether the impetus for startingup a new business vests entirely with the entrepreneur or what role the context plays in patterningthe work of the entrepreneur with respect to firm creation. As pointed out by Gartner (1988) asking`who is the entrepreneur?' is the wrong question. For that purpose, we believe that the context ofthe entrepreneur, networks and embedded routines, provides an opportunity to understand how thecontext contributes in shaping the entrepreneurial act.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The unprecedented escalation in the number of organisations that have decided tointernationalise their operations in the last two decades, and the internationalmovement of labour that has accompanied such expansion, has meant thatunderstanding the process of knowledge sharing within subsidiary operations hasbecome an issue of increasing importance. Where the cultural distance between homeand host nations is great, as it is between Western industrialised economies and thetransition economies of the (former) Communist nations, there is even greatersaliency for achieving effective knowledge sharing if its potential value for gainingorganisational competitive advantage is to be harnessed. In examining knowledgesharing in Russia and China, this paper specifically addresses how group membershipand personal networking in these countries facilitate and impede knowledge sharing.Ultimately, the paper provides important insights for Western managers about how to optimise knowledge sharing in their subsidiary operations in Russia and China.Key Words : Knowledge sharing, group membership, personal networking,Russia, China, Western Managers</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper argues that knowledge mapping may provide a fruitful avenue for intellectual capitalmanagement in academic environments such as university departments. However, while some researchhas been conducted on knowledge mapping and intellectual capital management in the public sector,the university has so far not been directly considered for this type of management. The paper initiallyreviews the functions and techniques of knowledge mapping and assesses these in the light of academicdemands. Secondly, the result of a focus group study is presented, where academic leaders were askedto reflect of the uses of knowledge mapping at their departments and institutes. Finally a number ofsuggestions are made as to the rationale and conduct of knowledge mapping in academe.Keywords: Knowledge mapping, academic, intellectual capital management, focus group, researchmanagement</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Empirical studies on the impact of knowledge management on the performance of MNCsubsidiaries remain elusive to date. This study examines the effect of knowledgemanagement tools such as corporate university, communities of practice, groupbenchmarking, learning systems and rewards upon absorptive capacity and performancewith unique data from subsidiary units in a large German MNC - Heidelberger Cement.The findings suggest that knowledge management tools unfold their performanceimpact through their significant influence on absorptive capacity and knowledgeinflows. The key contributions to the current literature on knowledge flows in the MNCinclude an empirically corroborated link between deployments of knowledgemanagement tools and their impact on the subsidiary employee's ability and motivationto learn from internal knowledge flows in the MNC as well as their impact onsubsidiary business performance.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>When building up competences, a subsidiary of a multinational corporation (MNC) may rely onexternal knowledge sources like customers, suppliers, competitors or local science centers. Internalsourcing is also available through knowledge offered by headquarters or other affiliates. Thequestion is whether the two kinds of sources are mutual exclusive. A dilemma or organizationaltrade-off is foreseeable, since the more the subsidiary adapts its knowledge creation processes tohost country institutions, the less it will be able to utilize internal knowledge sources due to theinstitutional distance between the external and internal networks. However, newer organizationalforms, like the concept of the `differentiated MNC', imply a relatively smooth flow of knowledgeinside the MNC, indicating that we should not expect an organizational trade-off between internaland external sources. The subsidiary's ability to build on two knowledge networks depends on itsscale of resources, absorptive capacity and the role it plays in the corporation.The relationship between internal and external sourcing is tested using a unique dataset that coversmore than 2,000 subsidiaries located in seven different European countries (the Centre of ExcellenceProject). In fact, the results show that, to a certain extent, there is no dilemma between asubsidiary's knowledge development based on both internal, and external knowledge sources.However, the results also show a bell-shaped relationship between the use of internal and externalsources, where a heavily embedded use of internal sources excludes the use of external sources.Keywords: Internal sourcing, External sourcing, Institutional Isomorphism and Subsidiaryknowledge.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We examine the argument, put forward by modern management writers and,in a somewhat different guise by Austrian economists, that authority is not aviable mechanism of coordination in the presence of `distributed knowledge'(which corresponds to Hayek's treatment of the use of dispersed knowledgein society). We define authority and distributed knowledge and argue thatauthority is compatible with distributed knowledge. Moreover, it is not clearon theoretical grounds how distributed knowledge impacts on economicorganization. An implication is that the Austrian argument that designedorders are strongly constrained by the Hayekian knowledge problem (Hayek,Kirzner, Sautet) is shaky. The positive flipside of this argument is thatAustrians confront an exciting research agenda in theorizing how distributedknowledge impacts economic organization.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The study explores what factors influence the reduction of managers' perceivedknowledge gaps in the context of the environments of foreign markets. Potentialdeterminants are derived from traditional internationalization theory as well asorganizational learning theory, including the concept of absorptive capacity. Building onthese literature streams a conceptual model is developed and tested on a set of primarydata of Danish firms and their foreign market operations. The empirical study suggeststhat the factors that pertain to the absorptive capacity concept - capabilities ofrecognizing, assimilating, and utilizing knowledge - are crucial determinants ofknowledge gap elimination. In contrast, the two factors deemed essential in traditionalinternationalization process theory - elapsed time of operations and experientiallearning - are found to have no or limited effect.Key words: Internationalization, knowledge gap, absorptive capacity, learning box.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Management researchers have suggested that knowledge sharing has an importantrole to play in developing competitive advantage for organisations. It could be arguedthat the need to build advantage is even greater in the transition economies that areincreasingly internationally oriented. Yet, it has been suggested that people intransition economies such as Russia and China have a propensity not to shareknowledge. We proffer that Russians' and Chinese' willingness to share knowledge ishighly influenced by group membership. By examining the extent to which groupmembership influences the processes of knowledge sharing in the Chinese andRussian cultural and institutional environments, we theoretically explore how in-groupsand out-groups facilitate and impede knowledge sharing.Key Words: China, In-groups, Knowledge Sharing, Out-groups, Russia</dc:description>

We argue that managers can shape formalorganization structure and organization forms and can influence the moreinformal organizational practices in order to foster knowledge sharing andcreation. Theoretically, we unfold this argument by relying on key ideas oforganizational economics and organizational behaviour studies. We put forwarda number of refutable propositions derived from this reasoning.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Anna Grandori for numerous excellent comments on anearlier draft.

					<dc:description>While examining the macroeconomic effects of increased governmentcontrol of the informal sector, this paper develops a two-sectorgeneral equilibrium model featuring matching frictions and worker-firm wage bargaining. Workers search for jobs in both the formaland the informal sector. We analyse the impact of higher punishmentrates and a higher audit rate on labour market performance. We findthat a higher punishment rate reduces the size of the informal sectorand reduces unemployment. A higher audit rate has an ambiguousimpact on unemployment, and may actually increase the size of theunderground economy.JEL-codes: H26Keywords: Tax evasion, underground economy, matching, bargaining,unemployment.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>What has power to do with Human Resource Management (HRM)? Perusing HRMtextbooksone will find, that power as a concept, only seldom is approached explicitly.When the subject of power is addressed directly, it is primarily as a question ofbargaining power between organisation and labour market institutions, the power of aleader or person in terms of the right to execute punishment and the duty to obedienceor empowerment, as a countermove to the effects of bureaucratic workplace routines`... where initiative is stifled and workers become alienated'1. Indirectly one canidentify power as interesting in the HRM-literature, as a question of influence or statusof HRM as a function in business. Does or does HRM not play a central role inbusiness? Is HR part of top management? That is questions concerned with how poweris distributed as a commodity in reality.This paper is taking up the concept of power as a distributing force of reality, asopposed to a distribution of commodities in reality. In this way the position on poweradopted is similar to the in Deleuzes words very simple definition of power byFoucault: `Power is a relation between forces, or rather every relation between forcesis a `power relation.' (Deleuze 1999: 70). This way of conceptualising power has as aconsequence, that power always has several sides:Power is not essentially repressivePower is not unilateral, but requires both `masters and mastered'Power is practiced more than it is possessed.The first point is serving as both the way in and the way out of this paper. The paperwill pry at the workings of power in order to unfold power as a positive as well asrepressing force using HRM as the practice where power is working. `The exercise ofpower is a `conduct of conducts' and a management of possibilities' (Foucault, 2000:341) Consequently, the way to study power is not to try to `find it', but to see, how it ispracticed. (Deleuze, 1999: 71) Studying power in HRM therefore becomes a questionon grasping the power relations and force fields emerging from HRM-practice. Onecould therefore ask the question: `What is HR about - and what is HR practice?'Barbara Townley (1994, 1998, 1999) has done this extensively and demonstrates how afoucauldian analysis focuses on practices, which structure social relations. (Townley,1998: 194) Townley conceptualizes HRM as the medium through which theemployment relationship may be organized or disciplined through technologies of theself.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This article examines why Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in 2001 turneddown a proposal for an EU take-over directive? The first explanation focuses on partyideology. However, MEPs overwhelmingly voted according to national rather than partylines. Two additional explanations emphasise national characteristics: labour marketlegislation (national schemes to protect employees against dismissals) and corporategovernance issues. Labour market legislation can explain the UK and German MEP votesbut not the Swedish and French MEPs votes. These votes can be explained byemphasising measures against take-overs such as a high level of market capitalisation andunequal voting rights.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>There is a limited amount of studies, which investigate how different managerialpractices may influence the behavior of knowledge senders in multinationalcorporations (MNCs). This paper addresses this gap by looking at whether and howcertain expatriation practices can enhance a) the ability and b) the willingness ofexpatriates to transfer the knowledge they possess from the headquarters to therespective subsidiaries. By stepping on two bodies of literature, namely theknowledge transfer literature and the expatriation literature, we suggest that MNCsmay enhance the expatriates' willingness to transfer their knowledge through theemployment of long-term expatriation practices. Expatriates' ability to transferknowledge may be increased through their involvement in short-term assignments,frequent flyers arrangements and international commuters practices. We testempirically the hypotheses on the basis of data from 92 subsidiaries of Danish MNCslocated in 11 countries.Key words: knowledge transfer, MNC, expatriation, dissemination capacity</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Economics in general, and the theory of the firm more specifically, placesmotivation and cognition in very different analytical boxes, in spite ofcognitive science evidence that the boundaries between the two are inreality blurred. While this analytical assumption has often served thetheory of the firm well, a number of organizational phenomena are betterunderstood if cognition and motivation are allowed to interact, forexample, through framing effects, as organizational scholars have longargued. The paper exemplifies by developing the implications of this forWilliamson's notion of the `impossibility of selective intervention.'Keywords: The theory of the firm, cognitive and motivational varialtion,selective intervention.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper provides an assessment of Greenland's tax system and contemplates changes that may beundertaken in the future to prepare for greater economic self-reliance and for the country's participationin the wider world economy. At the outskirts of Europe, Greenland is an autonomous part of theDanish kingdom, though currently not a member of EU. However, its cooperation with Europeancountries and its dependency on international trade renders it necessary for the tax system in Greenlandto be attuned to developments in the rest of the world. Drawing on a thorough international benchmarkinganalysis of Greenland's tax system, the paper's special focus will be on the corporate tax systemand its interplay with personal taxation, as well on as the system of import duties. In particular, wecarry out computations of effective marginal and average corporate tax rates, as well as average effectivetax burdens on consumption, labour income and capital income, and compare these to similarmeasures for EU countries. In addition, we outline how Greenland's economic policy in other areasinterferes with tax policy. Especially fishery regulation, management of government-owned companies,and housing policy have major implications for the tax system.Key words: international benchmarking, effective tax rates, GreenlandJEL: H20, H25</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Forbrugernes ønsker ikke at ændre deres indkøbsvaner for at handle dagligvarer via nettet,men de, der har prøvet at e-handle er mere positive overfor at handle over nettet og finderdet mindre risikofyldt sammenlignet med de, der ikke har prøvet at handle dagligvarer overnettet. Dette betyder, at det er vigtigt at få forbrugerne til at prøve ordningerne f.eks. viatilbud og/eller forskellige medlemsfordele for at motivere dem til at indgå i ordningen. Detviser to nye undersøgelser gennemført af forskere fra Institut for Afsætningsøkonomi,Handelshøjskolen i København i samarbejde med forskere fra Lunds Universitet,Avdelingen for Forpackningslogistik. Undersøgelsen er en del af Ebizz Øresund, der ersamfinansieret af det svenske Vinnova og det danske ministerium for Videnskab,Teknologi og Udvikling.Forbrugerne angiver som de to vigtigste fordele ved e-handel, at de dels sparer meget tid,dels at de bliver mindre afhængige af butikkernes åbningstider. De vigtigste ulemper set fraforbrugerside er dels at online handel er mindre spændende end køb i supermarkedet, delsat der er begrænset adgang til at se og føle på varerne før køb i online butikken. Det er dogforbrugere, der ikke har handlet på nettet, der mest markant har denne holdning.Firs procent af forbrugerne ønsker kun at betale et gebyr på maksimalt 60 kr. for at fåleveret dagligvarerne til døren og 38 procent ønsker endda kun at betale maksimalt 20 kr..Èn mulig vej for at få kickstartet e-handel med dagligvarer kunne være at forbrugerneslipper for at betale gebyr, når de køber over et vist beløb, f.eks. 800 kr. pr. køb. Menforbrugerne ønsker gratis levering allerede ved et indkøbsbeløb på 200 - 600 kr. pr. gang.Erfaring med e-handel med dagligvarer forøger ikke forbrugerens vilje til købe stort. Desmå købsbeløb skyldes sandsynligvis, at mange forbrugere lader sig inspirere i butikken,angående hvilke varer de skal købe til dagens aftensmad, især for frugt &amp; grønt og ferskekødvarer og frisk fisk. De planlægger med andre ord ikke hele deres dagligvareindkøb iforvejen og vil antage ligt være tilbageholdende med at foretage hele deresdagligvareindkøb online. En medvirkende årsag kan dog desuden være, at mangeforbrugere ikke har tilstrækkeligt med informationer til at kunne skønne omfanget af deomkostninger, som må bæres af online leverandøren i forbindelse med pakning,distribution mv. af dagligvarerne.Undersøgelsen viser, at et klart og gennemtænkt brand for hele e-handels butikken ervigtigt. Ikke bare en kopi af den eksisterende butikker. Set i dette lys kunne en fremtid fore-handel med dagligvarer være at støtte forbrugernes planlægning af måltiderne, f.eks.faste ugentlige måltidspakker med alle ingredienser vedlagt og med f.eks. én gratisugentlig levering ved køb over et bestemt beløb. Virksomheden kan beregne sig frem tilhvilket max. indkøbsbeløb pr. køb, der skal til, for at den tjener penge på at sælge. Gebyrfrilevering af dagligvarer har vist sig vigtig for at få gang i den hendøende e- handel. Hvisforbrugerne ønsker en bedre service, bør det også være muligt, men så skal gebyret kunnedække de faktiske omkostninger ved pakning, levering, administration, m.v.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>I dette working paper præsenteres og diskuteres et e-læringskoncept: Pædagogisk Selvtræning.Først vises den medietekniske udformning. Dernæst præsenteres et læringsteoretisk grundlag forkonceptet ud fra K. Illeris, 2001. Det starter ud fra de læringsprocesser (kognitive, psykodynamiskeog sociale), som foregår i brugere af konceptet, lærere så vel som studerende. Ud fra denne modeldiskuteres, hvordan denne viden kan være vejledende for lærerens resp. den studerendes direkteaktivitet i klasselokalet. Problemet for brugeren (en lærer eller en student) er dels at diagnosticeresituationen på holdet, ved eksamen e.l. og dels at finde/vælge en reaktionsmåde, der er relevanthertil. Det er disse kompetencer, Pædagogisk Selvtræning søger at udvikle. Til sidst diskuteres,hvordan Pædagogisk Selvtræning kan videreudvikles og indplaceres ift. andre, fx IT-baseredeundervisningsformer.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>I dette working paper præsenteres og diskuteres et e-læringskoncept: Pædagogisk Selvtræning.Først vises den medietekniske udformning. Dernæst præsenteres et læringsteoretisk grundlag forkonceptet ud fra K. Illeris, 2001. Det starter ud fra de læringsprocesser (kognitive, psykodynamiskeog sociale), som foregår i brugere af konceptet, lærere så vel som studerende. Ud fra denne modeldiskuteres, hvordan denne viden kan være vejledende for lærerens resp. den studerendes direkteaktivitet i klasselokalet. Problemet for brugeren (en lærer eller en student) er dels at diagnosticeresituationen på holdet, ved eksamen e.l. og dels at finde/vælge en reaktionsmåde, der er relevanthertil. Det er disse kompetencer, Pædagogisk Selvtræning søger at udvikle. Til sidst diskuteres,hvordan Pædagogisk Selvtræning kan videreudvikles og indplaceres ift. andre, fx IT-baseredeundervisningsformer.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In the last decade, scholarly interest has been mainly attracted on the nature of knowledge,mechanisms of knowledge production and the transformation of the institutions diffusingknowledge. Most of these studies share the underlying hypotheses that management knowledge`travels', as a package, from producers to passive receivers. A few exploratory attempts haveenvisioned an alternative perspective based on the idea of `knowledge consumption'. Managers areactive receivers of institutionalized knowledge in the course of enacting their organizational roles.Building on this last perspective, first we try to outline the process of knowledge consumption. Wedescribe how sources of knowledge are selected, knowledge is acquired and consumed by assumingthat managers are active consumer of management knowledge. Then, we construct the processlinking the flows of management knowledge in organizations and the flows of action performed bymanagers. We sustain that knowledge has to be first dis-embed from the context and artifacts it is into be translated into a portable form&amp;mdash;a standardized artifact, a logic of action, etc. Then, specificcourses of action are required to re-embed knowledge in new artifacts, practices or routines (e.g. abudgetary procedure, an organizational process, etc.). So, to re-embed knowledge in new contexts,managers have to mobilize resources and build consensus on the specific courses of action.By assuming this process, two consequences are derived: first, the dis-embedding/re-embeddingprocess is not the outcome of conscious planning; it goes back and forth, allows for controversial or`hypocritical' moves, at least in the short run. In any case, once management knowledge istranslated into logics of action, managers have to use their imaginative power to share these logicsto mobilize constituencies on priorities and undertake specific courses of actions This supports theidea that the managerial role is intrinsically political.Second, management education cannot simply deals with managerial recipes and rules of thumb. Itis increasingly asked for providing non-technical knowledge to help managers exert their politicalrole. To mobilize constituencies and create consensus on controversial decisions, technicalitiescould be less relevant than business-unrelated knowledge. We hold that has a relevant impact onboth the institutional settings and the content of management education.The paper is structured in three parts. First, a framework is proposed to describe managementknowledge consumption. Second, we outline the process linking consumed knowledge with actualmanagerial action. Third, the impact of this perspective on the structure of the institutions diffusingknowledge and on the idea of what is needed to make managerial decisions are explored.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper has a dual purpose. First, we suggest that entrepreneurs in their establishment of new businesses draw on a range of pre-existing socially embedded routines for creating acceptance by their environment. Also they draw upon external resources that are used in patterning specific practices. This ability is treated as entrepreneurial assets. Secondly, we argue that the existence and patterning of these socially embedded routines used in new business development are contingent on the institutional context. We see the institutional context as complex and fragmented, composed and shaped by different institutional domains: the normative, the cognitive and the regulatory domain.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The virus metaphor may be used in studies of management knowledge not only as a way ofdescribing diffusion processes but also as a way of thinking about viral elements of knowledgeproduction. In the present article, organizational viruses are viewed as ensembles of basicdistinctions that are constitutive of concrete bodies of knowledge and which form mutable enginesof organizational self-descriptions. Organizational viruses, we contend, are both characterized bystability in terms of their basic productive configuration, while at the same time allowing for a highdegree of variation in terms of concrete management knowledge and practice. The article isstructured as follows. After the introduction, we first develop the notion of organizational virus asinto an analytical approach. Second, we discern in the work of Frederick Taylor on scientificmanagement and Max Weber on bureaucracy, two quite distinct viral configurations that we claimhave infected most modern management knowledge - both on a discursive level and on the level ofconcrete organizational self-descriptions and practice. Third, we discuss our findings and raise thequestion of how viruses `work', how they interact, and why they become infectious.</dc:description>

					<dc:title>Technology strategy as macro-actor : Or how materials produce degrees of humanity in strategic research and practice</dc:title>

					<dc:description>The aim of this article is to inquire into the possible significance of materials in the production of emerging strategic outcomes. The article first sets out to discuss the different ways contemporary strategy research define the identity of strategic actors. It is argued that the various schools of strategy research, although different in important respects, operate with a common human centered assumption: Humanity is treated as given - the strategic actor or subject is assumed to be an individual human or a collective of humans.By adding the possible significance of materials and other non-human entities to the explanatory repertoire of strategy research, another line of inquiry is pursued. The performative perspective thus proposed, is inspired by the classical work of Von Clausewitz and the recent anthropology of science, technology and organizational identities. In the proposed perspective, the human centered assumption is no longer just a premise for doing strategy research, but instead considered an interesting emerging outcome to be explained. Further more, the performative perspective allows strategy research to extend the notion of emergent strategies so as to include the possible significance of materials and other non-human entities in the explanation of2emerging strategic identities and outcomes. Hence, also a new task has been added to strategy research: To explain how emerging strategic identities - consisting of both humans and non-humans, are produced as part of strategic outcomes.Three cases are presented, each of them with a particular bearing on how materials participate in the making of emerging strategic identities and outcomes:The first case account for strategies transforming plans into anti-plans. This is a case of how a strategic plan is betrayed (or rejected) by an emerging collective consisting of both humans and diverse materials like a paper inscription and heavy machinery.The second case account for how the emerging twin identities of the strategic management subject and the human object are co-produced in interaction with a machine delegate.Finally, the third case account for how the strategic technology and the strategic collective emerge and co-produce each other as a macro-actor, only to become transformed in unexpected ways - as common technology and reflective human subjects.In the concluding section, it is argued that the humanity of the reflective human subject should be regarded as an emerging identity, co-produced in interaction with diverse materials like machinery. It is further argued that strategy research has slowly written out Von Clausewitz original insight in this respect. The complexity Von Clausewitz introduced with the notion of `degrees of humanity' has been replaced with a given humanity, yet the costs of doing so remain outside the frames of contemporary strategy research. Failing to attend to the possible significance of materials in producing degrees of humanity has made strategy research as much producers of strategic outcomes, as providers of explanations and observations. The expression `technological strategy as macro-actor' summarizes these findings and the associated implications for research and practice.</dc:description>

The CASE-articles are some of the more quirkyarticles that have come out of the Molecular Microbial Ecology Group - a groupwhere I am currently making observational studies. They are the result of acooperation between Søren Molin, professor in the group, and his brother, JanMolin, professor at Department of Organization and Industrial Sociology atCopenhagen Business School. The cooperation arises from the recognition that bothmicrobial ecology and sociology/organization theory works with communities ofsorts. The articles explore if insights from the one field - organization theory - canbe used fruitfully in the other field - microbiology.The two articles are written as prolongations of each other and I will considerCASE I &amp; II to be two parts of the same textual body. It is my main goal with thisanalysis to localize actants and developmental dynamics, which I can use asguidelines in my later empirical analyses.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In the recent years the successful collaborative arrangements and relationships between university, industry and public institutions have become a mantra in transforming new scientific knowledge into new innovations and business ventures. The fit between these very different actor groups has been treated as a contingent factor. However only little attention have been giving to a specific focus on the strategies that new business ventures have obtained to establish the fit between small firms, university research, and public policies such as regulatory policies and R&amp;D policies. The emergence of the new biotechnologies and these techniques predominately coming from the university sector make the new biotechnology organizations an interesting object for studying these relationships both on a regional and a national level.From the perspective of the small biotechnology firms (SBFs) the paper explores four different strategies for dealing with network relations; the research oriented strategy, the incubator strategy, the industrial partnering strategy, and the policy-oriented strategy. The research-oriented strategy is narrowly focusing on how a biotechnology firm transforms their scientific results into promising technologies, services or products. The incubator strategy is concerned with localization and how to come about specific types of managerial problem in the initial stage of forming a business venture. The industrial partnering strategy concerns how to overcome the problem of bringing the technologies from an experimental stage at a research lab to be able handle industrial processes and full-scale production. Last but not least the policy oriented strategy focus on problem of having products approved by the public authorities.Theoretically the article draws upon network theories and a dynamic view of network relations. That is done in order to capture the nature of the relationships between different types of actors, but also in order to emphasize the informal nature of some of these relationships.The article has a dual purpose; 1) From a corporate point of view to emphasize multiple conditions for developing and forming interorganizational relationships, 2) From a research perspective to point to the diversity and heterogeneity of these relations and thereby emphasizes the evolutionary nature of these relations and their relatedness to the overall strategies obtained by the biotechnology entrepreneurs.The paper is structured so it will start out by stating its methodological foundations. Thereafter the theoretical positioning of the network approach will seek to argue that we have multiple network relationships are at play. Not only do these networks differ but also the institutional and organizational origins are to be touched upon to come to understand the nature of the biotechnology environment and the actors involved. The positioning of the SBFs as the focal point of the analysis leads to a discussion on entrepreneurial business strategies in biotechnology industry and how these business strategies in a very distinct mode is correlated with interorganizational relationships. The empirical evidence will be fleshed out in four cases representing each of the four suggested strategies. The conclusion discusses three implications of network partnering analysis. First, it discusses the theoretical contributions on the diversity, heterogeneity between the four partnering strategies. Second, it will point to future directions in the research. Third, the conclusion will point to the managerial challenges that can be foreseen.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Lad os forestille os, at man som studerende eller forsker nærmer sig en ny teori. Man har nu både hårdt arbejde og en række forvirrende episoder foran sig.Indledningsvis vil man typisk møde den nye teori som en lukket kasse. Man er selv placeret udenfor, men man kan konstater eeller få fortalt, at kassen gør bestemte ting. For eksempel kan man få at vide, at kassen/teorien tager bestemte typer af data ind og sender bestemte typer af forklaringer ud. I et optimistisk øjeblik tænker man måske, at det er relativt entydigt, hvad teorien handler om. Men denne fornemmelse af klarhed varer kun kort. Når man kommer lidt tættere på, opdager man at teorien ikke er én ting, men flere. Der er flere områder, flere væsentlige forfattere og flere varianter af teorien. Dertil kommer, at teorien er karakteriseret ved bestemte relationer: Nogle områder, forfattere og varianter hænger tydeligvis tæt sammen,mens andre har mindre med hinanden atgøre. Det kræver hårdt arbejde at få overblik over disse relationer, men det kan lade sig gøre. Man begynder at sætte pris på review-artikler, og man må i gang med at læse de nøgle tekster, som mange refererer til. Efter en ihærdig indsats kan man langsomt vinde klarheden tilbage. Man synes, man er ved at have greb om teorien. Man får måske endda fornemmelsen af at have den i sin hule hånd. Men præcis pådette tidspunkt begynder tingene at glide igen. Man opdager til sin overraskelse - og måske rædsel - at teorien faktisk ikke ligneren lukket kasse. Teorien er i vidudstrækning bygget på et udvalg af ældre teorier, som til lejligheden er blevet fortolket og anvendt på en særlig måde.Desuden er teorien er udviklet i samspil og konflikt med en række samtidige teorier.Teorien har således en livlig og betydningsfuld udenrigspolitik, som man helt har overset fordi man havde travlt medat orientere sig i indenrigspolitikken. De toformer for politik kan som bekendt ikke skilles ad, så nu åbner der sig igen en ny horisont: Hvis man skal finde ud af, hvad teorien er, må man opspore dens forbindelser til et sæt af forudgående og samtidige teorier. Hvordan kan man beskrive et fænomen, deri visse øjeblikke ligner en lukket kasse, men som ved nærmere eftersyn består af et uafgrænseligt virvar af elementer og relationer? Dette er i al sin enkelthed og i al sin kompleksitet, hvad aktør-netværksteori (ANT) beskæftiger sig med. ANT er en teori om teorier. Men ANT er også en teori om teknologi, videnskab,sociale aktører, samfund, natur og magt. Alle disse fænomener analyseres med den samme begrebsramme, nemlig den som er antydet i indledningen. Som en første approksimation kan vi sige, at aktørnetværksteori drejer sig om at tænke i punkter og forbindelser fremfor i kasser.I det følgende vil jeg introducere aktørnetværksteori på fra flere forskelligevinkler. Først vil jeg optegne nogle vigtige relationer til andre teoretiske traditioner (udenrigspolitikken) og de væsentligstedele af ANT (indenrigspolitikken). Hereftervil jeg indkredse den særlige analysestrategi som ANT står for. Hvordan analyserer man aktør-netværk? Hvad er de vigtigste analytiske redskaber og fremgangsmåder? og hvad betyder det, attænke på denne måde? I kapitlets anden del vil jeg gennemgå et antal klassiske ANT-analyser. Formålet med denne gennemgang er dels at give et indtryk af ANTs empiriske og teoretiskebidrag, dels at vise analysestrategien i praksis.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract. This paper advances a microtheory of creative action by examining howdistinctive artists shield their idiosyncraticstyles from the isomorphic pressures of afield. It draws on the cases of threeinternationally recognized, distinctiveEuropean film directors - Pedro Almodóvar(Spain), Nanni Moretti (Italy) and Lars vonTrier (Denmark). We argue that in a cinemafield, artistic pressures for distinctivenessalong with business pressures for profitsdrive filmmakers' quest for optimaldistinctiveness. This quest seeks bothexclusive, unique style and inclusive,audience-appealing artwork with legitimacyin the field. Our theory of creative actionfor optimal distinctiveness suggests thatfilm directors increase their control bypersonally consolidating artistic andproduction roles, by forming closepartnership with committed producer, andby establishing own production company.Ironically, to escape the iron cage of localcinema fields, film directors increasinglycontrol the coupling of art and business,hence forging their own `iron cage'.`[T]he unusual and paradoxical place thatPedro [Almodóvar] has been able to find:we are within the industry but we preserveour peculiarity.' (Agustín Almodóvar,2001).Optimal distinctiveness: `social identity isviewed as reconciliation of opposing needsfor assimilation and differentiation fromothers.'

					<dc:description>In this essay we will demonstrate that the role of project management in organisational changeprocesses is a mixture of rational and non-rational features. It is also colourful, difficult, interesting,and messy.We have named the paper `An Essay on'. An essay means treating a topic freely from differentangles, although not forgetting the sources you used. The implication of this is that we are not ableor willing to make an encompassing study of the literature on project management3. We thus knowthat many angles will not be covered. Furthermore we do not intend a make a negative delineation,indicating what we are not dealing with. We prefer to make a positive delineation, emphasisingwhat we are going to take up in our essay.Positively phrased we are inspired by 3 sources that will make the foundation for our differentangles:1. Decision making theory (Enderud,1976)4. One of the authors has previously with successapplied decision-making theory as an approach for analysing organisation change processes5. Both authors have followed the same line in analysing organisational changes inthe Danish public sector6. That success has inspired us to re-use the distinction betweenrational, political and anarchic processes in this essay 7. Enderud (1976:21-22) excludesexplicitly the role of the actors' participation in his presentation of decision models. Wefind, however this aspect so important that we have decided to include it2. Buchanan and Boddy´s analysis of the character of change8: The authors characterise thechange project in to dimensions. One pertains to the activities concerned: Are we dealingwith peripheral or core activities of the organisation. The second dimension deals with themagnitude of the change. Buchanan and Boddy use the scale: incremental - radical9.Furthermore Buchanan and Boddy makes a useful distinction between `publicperformance' (on stage) of rationally considered and logically phased and visiblyparticipative change and `backstage activity' in the recruitment and maintenance of supportand in seeking and blocking resistance (ibid p.27)3. We will apply data from our own case studies. We will use a format that we call anillustration, thereby indicating that we `only' illustrate a point. We do not prove it10. Ourcases are almost all from the public sector or from trade unions. Most of them have beenpublished elsewhere.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This report contains the major results from a study of management development in Danishorganizations. The study is part of a European research project with participation ofDenmark, the U.K, France, Norway, Rumania, Spain, and Germany. The project is part ofthe so-called Leonardo program the purpose of which is to further cross-countrycompetence development and collaboration within the European educational sector. Thefirst phase of the project is a quantitative interview study of one hundred organizations ineach of the participating countries. The second phase consists in qualitative case studiesin selected organizations in each of the countries. In Denmark one hundred and oneorganizations have participated in the study.Identical questionnaires and interviews are conducted in all of the mentioned countries andthe huge amount of data is analyzed in each country and across countries. The findingswill be published in books, journals and newspaper articles. Hopefully the findings of thelarge European project will thus affect the way in which educational institutions andorganizations manage the `Europeanization' of management development.The present report solely describes significant findings from the questionnaire studyconducted in Denmark. Two hundred and two managers have participated, that is two fromeach organization. We thank the contributing organizations without which it would not havebeen possible to generate this picture of management development in Danishorganizations.The Department of Organization and Industrial Sociology at the Copenhagen BusinessSchool is the Danish partner in the project. The project has been conducted by CamillaLeth in collaboration with Ilse Kristensen, Mette Gundersen and Lea Green under thesupervision of Henrik Holt Larsen. Anne-Mette Hjalager has contributed to the preparationof the report.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Artiklen indeholder en diskussion af Værdipapirhandelslovens forbud modinsider handel. Der redegøres for tesen om effektive markeder. Medudgangspunkt i økonomisk teori redegøres for argumenter for et forbud. Derargumenteres for at, at insiderforbudets økonomiske berettigelsen medfordel kan støttes på tesen om effektive markeder. Det er i modsætninghertil blevet gjort gældende i den nyeste børsretlige teori, at denøkonomiske teori om effektive markeder ikke er et adækvat grundlag forinsider reglerne, og at denne teori bør erstattes af den såkaldte Lemon-teori,formuleret af Akerlof. Artiklen gør gældende, at det ikke er uden problemerat overføre Akerlof's teori til de finansielle markeder, eftersom der ikketages hensyn til markedets selvregulerende mekanismer, som mindskerproblemet med asymmetrisk information. Artiklen afsluttes med endiskussion af de reguleringsmæssige konsekvenser som følge af valg af detøkonomiske grundlag for insiderforbudet.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract: This article analyzes the conflict of interests between shareholders andother stakeholders, including when such conflicts of interests may arise. It is arguedthat shareholder value cannot be justified simply by referring to any prerogativeproperty rights of the shareholders. Instead, shareholder value coincides with theefficient hypothetical perfect contract. However, due to contractual failures in certainbargain situations, management may be unable to `internalize the firms externalities'.This means that in these situations there is a tradeoff between a broad duty of loyaltyfor management in listed firms and other traditional remedies. The theoretical insightsare applied on a case from the Danish Supreme Court (Louis Poulsen A/S) where theinterests of the stakeholders were decisive. However, it is shown that the verdict mayinstead harm the relevant stakeholders illustrating how cautious the legal systemshould use a doctrine based on the `company's interests'. In addition, the notion of afirm's social responsibility is critically evaluated together with the associated pitfallsof accepting this concept.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>A central issue in science policy today is the changing role and function ofresearch evaluation. How is quality selected, has local organizational traditionsand managerial practices influence on the research evaluation? Who isperceived as peers or evaluators by the researchers and by managers? Recentorganizational theory has focused on organizational and social dimensions inprivate knowledge-based companies, but left out research organizations. Howimportant is the organizational context for the research evaluation processes?The paper will present results from an interview-based study of four privateand public research organizations and discuss the importance of theorganizational context on the production of new knowledge.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The objective of this paper is to explore the associations made in mass mediatedarticulations of biotechnology. It serves as the basis for further analyses of massmediated controversies and the purpose is to establish a map of the landscape ofmass mediated articulation of biotechnology. Which kinds of genetic researchand technology are articulated in what way? What can be associated to what inthe mass mediation and when is it portrayed as controversial? In short this is astudy of associations in the news production that serves as a way of establishingan empirical archive for further work. It is based on a relational ontologyinspired by French philosopher Bruno Latour, supplemented with the method ofcontent analysis developed within sociology of mass media. The aim is to studythe production of networks of articulation in mass media by looking at theoutcome (the articles), which they produce.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This report is based on the survey "Industrial Companies in Denmark - Today and Tomorrow',section IV: Supply Chain Management - Practices and Performance, question number 4.9 onperformance assessment. To our knowledge, this survey is unique, as we have not been able to findresults from any compatible survey. The International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) doesbring up the question of supply chain management, but unfortunately, we did not have access to thedatabase. Data from the members of the SCOR-model, in the form of benchmarked performance data,may exist, but are nonetheless not public. The survey is a cooperative project "Benchmarking DanishIndustries" with CIP/Aalborg University, the Danish Technological University, the DanishTechnological Institute and Copenhagen Business School as consortia partners. The project has beenfunded by the Danish Agency for Trade and Industry. The present survey was developed andconducted in the period of 2001-2003.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>E-learning området er meget varieret hvad angår produkter, holdninger ogmeninger, og indeholder også en del 'støj' og mytedannelser, som afspejles i såvel denakademisk-videnskabelige som den journalistisk-offentlige debat om området. Dennevariation i såvel produkter som udtrykte meninger søges systematiseret og ordnet i fireidealtypiske paradigmer. Det vises, hvorledes disse fire paradigmer har hver sinebestemte karakteristika og udviklingsgrænser. Dette har afgørende strategisk betydningfor virksomheders og læreanstalters udvikling af e-learning, idet forkerte paradigmevalgvil hæmme udviklingen.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper addresses the issue of using product models to support product lifecycle activities withparticular focus on the production phase. The motivation of the research is that products are producedmore costly and with longer lead-time than necessary.The paper provides a review of product modelling technologies and approaches, and the overallarchitecture for the Product State Model (PSM) Environment as a basis for quality monitoring.Especially, the paper focuses on the circumstances prevailing in a one-of-a-kind manufacturingenvironment like the shipbuilding industry, where product modelling technologies already haveproved their worth in the design and engineering phases of shipbuilding and in the operation phase.However, the handling of product information on the shop floor is not yet equally developed.The paper reports from the Brite-Euram project (No. BE97-4510) QualiGlobe focusing on thedevelopment activities of the PSM architecture. An example discusses how to handle product relatedinformation on the shop floor in a manufacturing company and focuses on how dynamically updatedproduct data can improve control of production activities. This prototype example of welding a jointbetween two steel plates serves as proof of concept for the PSM architecture.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Empirical studies on the impact of knowledge management on the performance of MNCsubsidiaries remain elusive to date. This study examines the effect of knowledgemanagement tools such as corporate university, communities of practice, groupbenchmarking, learning systems and rewards upon absorptive capacity and performancewith unique data from subsidiary units in a large German MNC - Heidelberger Cement.The findings suggest that knowledge management tools unfold their performanceimpact through their significant influence on absorptive capacity and knowledgeinflows. The key contributions to the current literature on knowledge flows in the MNCinclude an empirically corroborated link between deployments of knowledgemanagement tools and their impact on the subsidiary employee's ability and motivationto learn from internal knowledge flows in the MNC as well as their impact onsubsidiary business performance.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In globalizing competitive markets knowledge exchangebetween business organizations requires incentivemechanisms to ensure tactical purposes while strategicpurposes are subject to joint organization and otherforms of contractual obligations. Where property ofknowledge (e.g. patents and copyrights) and contractbasedknowledge exchange do not obtain networkeffectiveness because of prohibitive transaction costs inreducing uncertainty, we suggest a robust model for peerproduced knowledge within a distributed setting. Thepeer produced knowledge exchange model relies upon adouble loop knowledge conversion with symmetricincentives in a network since the production of actorspecific knowledge makes any knowledge appropriationby use of property rights by the actors irrelevant. Withoutproperty rights in knowledge the actor network generatesopportunity for incentive symmetry over a period of time.The model merges specific knowledge with knowledgefrom other actors into a decision support system specificfor each actor in the network in recognition of actor roledifferences. The article suggests a set of 9 static and 5dynamic propositions for the model to maintainsymmetric incentives between different actor networks.The model is proposed for business networks.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>While still short of being entirely mainstream there does appear to be a growing recognition in bothpolicy circles and academia that economic development is not brought about by autonomous profitmaximisingagents interacting anonymously through equilibrium markets.1 Rather, economicdevelopment is an inherently disequilibric process involving interactive and institutionallyembedded processes in broader systems of firms, governments, research centres, universities,consultants, and other entities. These systems can tap into stocks of global knowledge andtechnologies, assimilate and adapt it to local circumstances, and create new knowledge ortechnologies.Such broader production systems are conceptualised in several different ways in the literature,e.g. Lundvall et al.'s `national innovation systems', Richard Whitley's `business systems', andSanjaya Lall's concept of `industrial technology development'. This paper identifies and outlinesfour different systemic approaches to economic development. All four approaches have primarilybeen developed to address nationally based institutional systems in advanced economies.Both the ontological premises and the policy implications of these systemic approaches departdistinctly from the conventional orthodoxy on economic development as articulated in the`Washington Consensus' and its later derivatives. The article goes on to explore which policyimplications the adoption of such a systemic view might have for the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This report maps research in institutional economics in management science in the European Union for the 1995 to 2002 period. The reports applies Internet search based on a university listing, search on journal databases, key informants and an internet-based survey. 195 researchers are identified. In (sub-)disciplinary terms, organization, strategy, corporate governance, and international business are the major areas of application of institutional economics ideas. In terms of countries, the EU strongholds are Holland, Denmark, UK, and Germany. There is apparently no or very little relevant research in Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg and Greece. Based on the findings of the report, it seems warranted to characterize the EU research effort in the field as being rather dispersed and uncoordinated. Thus, there are no specialized journals, associations or PhD courses. This state of affairs is partly explainable by the highly pragmatic way in which research in management science is typically conducted (so that institutional economics approaches are likely to be merely one type of input among many). Keywords Institutional economics, management science, European union.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Dette Working Paper indeholder nogle foreløbige resultater af en analyse af den diskursive praksis som den kom til udtryk i de ansvarlige ministres kommunikation under kogalskabskrisen i Danmark og Spanien i 2000 og 2001. Working Paperet fokuserer på den daværende danske fødevareminister Ritt Bjerregaards interaktion med landmændene og tager sit metodiske udgangspunkt i den kritiske diskursanalyse. Analysen viser at på trods af de fremtrædende handelsøkonomiske og politiske promoveringsdiskurser kommer landbrugsreformer og etik til at fremstå som det man hæfter sig ved i talen. Dette hjælpes på vej retorisk via appeller til fælles sandheder og konstant inddragelse og iscenesættelse af landmændene som tilhørende et interessefællesskab hvor det handler om at skabe et bæredygtigt landbrug baseret bl.a. på dyrevelfærd, økologi og miljø. Denne artikel skal ses som et diskussionsoplæg, hvor jeg vil lægge op til refleksion over begreberne kohærens, diskurs og argumentation ved at vise en analyse foretaget inden for rammerne af Faircloughs version af den kritiske diskursanalyse (1992, 1995, 2000, 2003). Analysen er en del af en større undersøgelse af politisk kommunikation, men vil her fokusere på to aspekter af det Fairclough kalder 'diskursiv praksis', nemlig 1) hvordan forskellige diskurser kommer ind i en tekst (interdiskursivitet) og 2) hvordan teksten lægger op til en bestemt fortolkning (kohærens). Den diskursive begivenhed denne artikel vil behandle er en tale Ritt Bjerregaard holdt på Landbrugsraadets Årsmøde i maj 2001. Tekstens kontekst er BSE-sagen, der involverede hele EU for et par år siden, og tidspunktet ligger efter at de værste kontroverser om kompensationsordninger mv. mellem den daværende landbrugsminister og landbrugets repræsentanter havde fundet sted. Talen tager således sit afsæt i fortiden, men dens formål er fremadskuende og handler mest om hvordan Danmark, Europa og især landmændene skal komme videre efter at have været sendt til tælling økonomisk og omdømmemæssigt af BSE, mund-og klovsyge og andre fødevarekriser. Historien her kommer dog ikke til at handle så meget om selve sagen og dens forløb; jeg har i stedet valgt at fokusere på de kommunikative aspekter i diskursanalysen. Mit formål er på længere sigt at videreudvikle Faircloughs analysebegreber 'interdiskursivitet' og 'kohærens', som jeg mener er områder han ikke har udfoldet helt i sin tilgang til kritisk diskursanalyse. Undersøgelsen skal på et tidspunkt ende med at fortælle noget om hvad henholdsvis Ritt Bjerregaard og den spanske landbrugsminister Miguel Arias Cañete fik ud af kogalskabskrisen. Indgik den fx som en kærkommen lejlighed til at forsøge at sætte ETISKE spørgsmål ved landbrugsproduktion, blev den brugt i et POLITISK ærinde til at argumentere for mere lovgivning, handlede den måske kun om at få ØKONOMIEN til at fungere igen, eller var det en blanding af alle tre (og flere med måske) synsvinkler? Og i givet fald, hvis alle disse rationaliteter var i spil samtidig, hvad lod ministeren så stå tilbage som den enkle konklusion borgeren og landmanden kunne drage?</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In this paper we set up a model of start-up finance under double moral hazard.Entrepreneurs lack own resources and business experience to develop their ideas.Venture capitalists can provide start-up finance and commercial support. The effortput forth by either agent contributes to the firm's success, but is not verifiable. Asa result, the market equilibrium is biased towards inefficiently low venture capitalsupport. The capital gains tax becomes especially harmful, as it further impairsadvice and causes a first-order welfare loss. Once the capital gains tax is in place,limitations on loss off-set may paradoxically contribute to higher quality of venturecapital finance and welfare. Subsidies to physical investment in VC-backed startupsare detrimental in our framework.Keywords: Venture capital, capital gains taxation, double moral hazard.JEL-Classification: D82, G24, H24, H25</dc:description>

					<dc:description>While examining the macroeconomic effects of government taxand punishment policies, this paper develops a three-sector generalequilibrium model featuring matching frictions and worker-firm wagebargaining. Workers are assumed to differ in ability, and the choiceof education is determined endogenously. Job opportunities in an informalsector are available only to workers who choose not to acquirehigher education. We find that increased punishment of informal activitiesincreases the number of educated workers and reduces the number of unemployed workers. Considering welfare, we show it isoptimal to choose punishment rates so to more than fully counteractthe distortion created by the government's inability to tax theinformal sector.JEL-codes: H26, I21, J64Keywords: Tax evasion, underground economy, education, matching,unemployment.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The paper looks at initiatives taken by the Mexican Employers' Confederation (COPARMEX)aimed at promoting collaboration among civil society associations around the issue of publicsafety. Insecurity in the form of robbery, assault and kidnapping causes huge losses to business inMexico. It is argued that business leaders are seeking to create consensus and form alliancesamong civil society around the topic of insecurity, both to combat crime but also as a strategy tostrengthen links with civil society and improve the image of business, which has suffered due to theincreasing resonance of anti-capital and anti-globalisation discourses in the region.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The focus of this paper is to integrate various perspectives on product architecture modularity into a general framework, and also to propose a way to measure the degree of modularization embedded in product architectures. Various trade-offs between modular and integral product architectures and how components and interfaces influence the degree of modularization are considered. In order to gain a better understanding of product architecture modularity as a strategy, a theoretical framework and propositions are drawn from various academic literature sources. Based on the literature review, the following key elements of product architecture are identified: components (standard and new-to-the-firm), interfaces (standardization and specification), degree of coupling, and substitutability. A mathematical function, termed modularization function, is introduced to measure the degree of modularization embedded in product architectures, by taking the key elements as the main variables. Various managerial and theoretical implications of the modularization function are drawn. For instance, the function can be used as a framework to aid to examine various leveraging forces behind new product development, manufacturing, and supply chain management policies of a firm. The modularization function also allows us to study the implications of modularization from different theoretical perspectives, such as resource-based view of the firm and transaction cost economics. Finally, the application of the modularization function and its limitations are discussed.Key words: modularity, product architecture</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The standard of proof in criminal law a®ects retributive justice throughthe number of wrong convictions and wrong acquittals. It also a®ects thelevel of crime, since a higher standard of proof implies less deterrence andless incapacitation. This article derives an expression for the optimal standardfrom a trade-o® between these e®ects, and applies the expression tothe crime of sexual violation against women. For this crime, social preferencesfor justice versus prevention of crime are elicited through a surveyand inserted into the expression for the optimal standard. The result indicatesthat the concern for prevention of crime may have a signi¯cant e®ecton the optimal standard of proof.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The New Economy is closely associated with computing &amp; communications technology, notablythe Internet. We discuss property rights to, and trade in, the difficult-to-define intangible assetsincreasingly dominating the New Economy, and the possibility of under-investment in theseassets. For a realistic analysis we introduce a Schumpeterian market environment (theexperimentally organized economy). Weak property rights prevail when the rights to access,use, and trade in intangible assets cannot be fully exercised. The trade-off between the benefitsof open access on the Internet, and the incentive effects of strengthened property rights, dependboth on the particular strategy a firm employs to secure property rights, and the protectionoffered by law. Economic property rights can be strengthened if the originator can findinnovative ways to charge for the intangible assets. The extreme complexity of the NewEconomy and the large number of possible innovative private contract arrangements make itmore important to facilitate the use and enforcement of private individualized contracts toprotect intellectual property than to rely only on standard mandatory patent and copyright law.Enabling law is one proposed solution. Current patent legislation in the US has led to costlylitigation processes weakening the position of small firms and individuals in patent disputes.The property rights of such firms and individuals could be strengthened with insurance orarbitration procedures.Key words: Competence bloc theory, Enabling law, Experimentally Organized Economy, NewEconomy, Weak property rights, Tradability, Underinvestment.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>We investigate the effect of changes in capital regulation on the strictness(leniency) of loan terms using a simple model of bank capital requirements andasset quality examinations. Banks offer different levels of `leniency' in the senseof willingness to offer automatic extensions of loans in the presence of temporarypayment difficulties of borrowers. Banks offering lenient (less strict) loan termsmust have higher initial levels of capital and charge higher loan rates. Whencapital requirements are increased, both strict and lenient banks hold higher levelsof initial capital and they raise loan rates. As capital requirements increase thedifference between initial capital levels and between interest rates of strict andlenient banks decrease. Thus, higher capital requirements in recessions tend toreduce the interest rate premium paid for leniency. If a recession is interpreted asan increase in the required return, the interest rate premium paid for leniency isincreased in recession at a given level of required capital.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>A constitution is more likely to be accepted if it federalizes those issues that arewidely seen as needing complete harmonization. A constitution is more likely to endure if thefederal government does not have powers that are not vital to it but which may alienate somemember states to the point that the federal government loses legitimacy. It appears vital tohave trade policy at the European Union level; for euro countries, monetary policy is alreadyfederalized. It is not clear that common foreign and defense policies are needed; insisting oncommon foreign and defense policies may lead to conflicts within and across member statesthat severely weaken the Union, conceivably contributing to eventual collapse. Insisting onharmonization of commercial codes does not have the destructive potential of attemptingcompletely to harmonize defense and foreign policies; it may, however, lead to needlessconflict that helps drain the reservoir of goodwill that the European Union will need fordealing with other conflicts amongst member states.</dc:description>

					<dc:title>Self-Denial in Federalizing Power in the European Union : Lessons from the Causes of the American Revolution</dc:title>

					<dc:description>Because the conflicts that led to the American Revolution mainly arose fromconstitutional issues, the history of these conflicts offers lessons for the design of the newEuropean Union constitution. One lesson is the importance of avoiding needless conflictsbetween federal and member-state governments. In particular, forcing decisions on wheresovereignty lies may cause great conflict. Another lesson is that a federal system depends ongood will among the federal and member-state governments, and because this good will is easilydissipated, efforts should be made to nurture it. Federal exercise of power will often alienatemember states; thus, a sensible strategy is to grant the federal government only the minimalpowers that a strong consensus agrees it must have, and to change these powers only by strongconsensus. Removing `democratic deficits' may not be sufficient in many cases to givelegitimacy to exercise of federal power; minorities may require protection by constitutionallimits on federal powers.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The U.S. Constitution importantly limits the degree to which the federal governmentcan impose harmonization across member states. This paper reviews these limitations andhow they have evolved substantially over time in the U.S. It also discusses some of thebenefits and costs of such limitations, and argues that the EU may benefit from adoptingsimilar limitations. Harmonization of EU tax codes is likely to be economically harmful. Ontheoretical grounds, tax rates are likely to be harmonized at a common rate that is higher thanoptimal for the EU. This suggests the benefits of constitutional provisions that make taxharmonization difficult to impose. Other types of harmonization have a less clear-cut costbenefitanalysis. A federal commercial code that is uniform across member states reducestransaction and information costs, compared to leaving important code issues to memberstates; further, many states may keep codes for long periods that are sub-optimal compared toa given federal code. A federal code may, however, fit poorly with other institutions ofmember states, potentially causing large costs. Leaving codes to the states leads tocompetition across states, and may generate forces for change for the better. Competition alsogenerates information about the effectiveness and costs of different commercial codes.Because any country's initial code is likely to be sub-optimal, and is likely to become lessoptimal over time, information on how to improve codes is valuable. Likely it is easier tolearn and adapt from member states than from other countries.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>If secession or expulsion ends in a `velvet divorce,' as with Czechoslovakia, costs areminimal and the split is relatively unimportant. High costs arise if a federation splits into mutuallyhostile, comparably sized regions. Perhaps the majority of splits lead to dangerous hostility. Awell-designed constitution minimizes the likelihood of hostile splits by limiting the issues that aredealt with at the federal level, by providing checks and balances, and by establishing due processunder the rule of law. Preventing the conditions under which a hostile split may arise is more costeffectivethan trying to optimize the terms of a split or to find last-minute compromises toforestall the split.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The post-Civil War reconciliation between the North and the South is a very rare eventin the history of civil wars. The South was thoroughly beaten. Top generals, particularly Robert E.Lee, saw further fighting as `useless effusion of blood.' There was no call by top Confederateleaders for continuing the fight with the type of bushwacking that occurred in Missouri andKansas. Reconstruction is often thought of as harsh, but compared to the standards of historyConfederates were by and large treated well after the Civil War. Within a decade or so of the endof the Civil War, conservative white elites had established political, economic and socialdominance in the South. They had lost their `slave property' and the `government of our own.'They could never get back slavery, and a government of their own was not worth fighting for.There was little reason for the kind of persistent low-level guerilla warfare that often occurs aftercivil wars, or the organization of a succession of rebellions.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract:Proponents of specific performance as a remedy for breach ofcontract have found support in the alleged use of the remedy inCivil Law countries. However, we provide evidence that specificperformance is in fact a rare remedy in Denmark, Germany andFrance, and under CISG, when performance requires actions to beundertaken, and we relate this to costs of enforcement. We arguethat it is administratively costly to run a system of enforcementthat renders specific performance attractive to the aggrieved party,and that the Civil Law countries have (like Common Law countries)chosen not to incur these costs of enforcement. This is especiallyclear in the case of Denmark, where specific performance of actionshas been abandoned as a legal remedy.At the normative level, we argue that enforcement costs providesan additional rationale, over and above the rationales of the theoryof efficient breach, for damages and against specific performanceas the general remedy.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The Danish companies are ahead of the US in B2C e-commerce. With the exception ofGermany, Denmark is leading the group of 10 countries included in the survey dataforming the basis for this report. The average global sample and countries as Germanyis performing substantial better than Denmark on B2B on-line sales.Danish companies have high level of investments in IT, have the lowest barriers for ecommerceand the highest levels of e-commerce drivers. On most indicators forreadiness e-commerce such as companies use of e-mail, intranet, EDI, extranet, andprovision of mobile services, the Danish business sector has adopted the technologiesthat can foster e-commerce further on.Yet, our analysis points to alarming and surprisingly findings. The companies haveprimarily managed to incorporate e-business in the processes controlled by thecompany themselves (marketing and customer service) but have failed to implement ebusinessin interorganizational system and business integration. Thus, the companiesappears to have the inhouse means aligned for e-commerce exploitation, but have yetto transform their external business relations. The financial sector is the bestperforming sector with regards to sales, but not leading the pack in on-line services.Also, deficiencies of e-services are found especially within manufacturing companies,where few companies are providing product configuration information and ordertracking. The Danish companies have failed to implement services such as giftcertificates and product catalogs at their web site.There are not a substantially higher number of Danish companies reporting onsuccesses in terms of more efficient business processes, increased staff efficiency, costreductions, increased sales areas etc. On several of these dimensions, there are evenfewer Danish companies reporting on positive e-commerce impacts.We group the policy implications of our analysis in four classes of actors (government,industry associations/service providers, companies and citizens/ individuals)suggesting that government will have to increase research, increase the production ofengineers, intensify and broaden public e-procurement and e-government, furtherfacilitate e-commerce (de-) regulation to boost on-line use in all business processes,further European harmonization of legislation regarding cross border on-line businessprocesses, accelerate liberalization of labor market to make it easier to expand andcontract, and increase public funding schemes for entrepreneurs.Finally, we point to the need for critically accessing the role of industryassociations/service providers in awareness campaigns, and stress the need for surveysand identification of weaknesses as well as best business practice and dissemination ofthis knowledge in spite of the reluctance of SME's to listen. For the companies, thereseems to be a need for giving higher priority to integration with suppliers/customers,focusing on exploiting benefits of e-business investments and higher awareness andengagement in e-marketplaces. For the citizens/ individuals the report discusses theneed for continued emphasis on further education and training in IT, languages andbusiness processes and the increased willingness to change.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Many companies in high technology fields engage with alliance partners to reduce risks, create synergies and learn. While the challenges of managing individual alliances are well documented, little is known on how to manage several R&amp;D alliances simultaneously. Multiple alliance strategies can be observed in several companies engaged in the cross section of telecommunication and mobile technology where increased complexity magnifies managerial challenges. Drawing on modern portfolio theory, this paper offers a model for managing portfolios of R&amp;D alliances. In particular, an analysis of a technology platform leader reveals how companies can reduce several types of risks associated with new technology and gain synergies by engaging in several alliances simultaneously.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>This paper draws on ideas in economics and game theory to develop a new theory of marketing and corporate communication in the emerging network economy. We argue that in a network economy, firms and consumers will confront `coordination problems.' With the emerging network economy all this become urgent because the availability and cost of information decreases. Also, timing issues becomes crucial as millions of people get access to the same information simultaneously. That explain why events where masses of viewers simultaneously participate in the same events become so important. We introduce a simple game theoretic model to explain this, and discuss marketing applications and possible strategies.Key wordsCoordination problems, common knowledge, corporate communication</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Baseret på et sample af de 1000 største danske virksomheder undersøgesforekomsten af nye arbejdsorganiseringsformer i dansk erhvervsliv. Endvidereundersøges det, hvilke virksomheder der typisk implementerer de nye måder atorganisere arbejdet på. Det vises at det primært er virksomheder ikonkurrenceprægede og vidensintensive brancher der gør dette. De nyearbejdsorganiseringsformer implementeres i bundter. Det indikerer at de nyeorganiseringsformer er komplementære. Deres forekomst er endelig tæt korreleretmed forekomsten af resultatløn. Det tyder på at 'kontrol'- og 'kommitment'-modeller for HRM ikke er modsatrettede, men tværtimod komplementære.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>ABSTRACTThe paper analyses the effect on manufacturers in Italy's footwear districts of international competition, and investigates the underresearched nature of the link between international competition and the internal cohesion of districts. It addresses if and how global competition provokes the (partial) geographic fragmentation of local supply chains, dislocating select local parts manufacturers in its wake. The findings suggest that when international competition threatens the viability of local production, firms with the requisite organisational capabilities delocalise parts of the value chain. This helps them to retain competitive advantages but it also reduces agglomeration. This insight should inform regional development policy.Keywords: Industrial districts, footwear industry, international competition, delocalisation</dc:description>

I discuss a framework for future empirical research on the relations betweenhuman resource management (HRM) practices and knowledge transfer in multinationalcorporations (MNC). The proposed model is empirically testable, includes a wider rangeof HRM practices and is not limited to one mode of foreign operations only.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractWe forge linkages between the economics of property rights (Coase, Demsetz,Cheung, Barzel) and strategic management. Property rights to resources consistof the rights to consume, obtain income from, and alienate these resources.Transaction costs are the costs of exchanging, protecting and capturing propertyrights. We clarify the key role of transaction costs with respect to understandingvalue creation and the limitations and opportunities of strategizing relative tocompetitive forces. The economics of property rights identifies new sources ofvalue creation (i.e., reducing the dissipation caused by transaction costs), andnew types of resources (i.e., capture and protection capabilities), clarifies the roleof contracting in the exercise of market power, and suggests that `strategizing'and `economizing' perspectives are related to a larger extent than is normallyrecognized. Refutable propositions are derived.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractWe discuss and empirically examine a firm-level equivalent of the ancient problem of `tying the King's hands,' namely how to maximize managerial intervention for `good cause,' while avoiding intervention for `bad cause.' Managers may opportunistically intervene when such intervention produces private benefits. Overall firm performance is harmed as a result, because opportunistic managerial intervention harms employee motivation. The central point of the paper is that various mechanisms and factors, such as managers staking their personal reputation, employees controlling important assets, strong trade unions, corporate culture, etc. may function as constraints on managerial proclivities to opportunistically intervene. Thus, firms can make credible commitments that check managerial proclivities to opportunistically intervene. We derive 5 hypotheses from these ideas, and test them, using path-analysis, on a rich dataset, based on 329 firms in the Spanish food and electric/electronic industries.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractIn a recent global competitiveness report by the IMF, the four Nordic countries all ranked in top ten, attesting to the region?s growing attractiveness as a host location for MNCs. This paper investigates the driving forces determining foreign direct investment flows into Scandinavia. We use a panel data set covering FDI inflows to Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland for the period 1979-2000. Results suggest that, in addition to traditional determinants of FDI, technological advantages of the region are of particular importance for foreign investors. Thus, evidence is provided for the changing pattern of international production indicating strategic needs for MNCs to acquire assets and technology that are specific to particular locations.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract:The balance of payments of Greenland has special features due to an important current transfer,bloktilskud, from Denmark. The trade balance does not exhibit a deficit of this order of magnitudebut comparison of the bloktilskud and the deficit is difficult as official figures are available for themerchandise trade only. Figures for services are missing. However, guesses about the size of adeficit in the services' trade do not easily discard the impression of a large surplus on the currentaccount. Over a ten year period it is suggested that accumulated surpluses could be twice the levelof Greenland's GDP. This seems unlikely, but the available data raise a puzzle that ought to beaddressed as it nourishes suspicion of unobserved accumulation of wealth.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Levy and Arditti (1973) introduced depreciable assets into the Modigliani andMiller (1958) model, and analyzed the implications for the cost of capital. Assumingthat the firm reinvests indefinitely to maintain a constant expected cash flow, theyfound that depreciation increases the cost of capital before and after tax. Most oftheir assumptions are maintained. However, commitment to perpetual reinvestmentis in most cases not a reasonable assumption. Without it, depreciation decreases thecost of capital before and after tax. The effect of depreciation is less in absolute valuethan in Levy and Arditti, but not insignificant.Keywords: Cost of capital, depreciation, corporate taxesJEL classification numbers: G31, H25</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractWe discuss the existence of a pooling equilibrium in a two-period modelof an insurance market with asymmetric information. We solve the modelnumerically. We pay particular attention to the reasons for non-existencein cases where no pooling equilibrium exists. In addition to the phenom-enon of cream skimming emphasized in earlier literature, we here pointto the the importance of the opposite: dregs skimming, whereby high-riskconsumers are proÞtably detracted from the candidate pooling contract.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>The concept of knowledge management has, indeed, become a buzzword that every single organization is expected to practice and live by. Knowledge management is about managing the organization's knowledge for the common good of the organization -but practicing knowledge management is not as simple as that. This article focuses on knowledge sharing as the process seeking to reduce the resources spent on reinventing the wheel.The article introduces the concept of time sensitiveness; i.e. that knowledge is either urgently needed, or not that urgently needed. Furthermore, knowledge sharing is considered as either a push or pull system. Four strategies for sharing knowledge - help, post-it, manuals and meeting, and advice are introduced. Each strategy requires different channels for sharing knowledge. An empirical analysis in a production facility highlights how the strategies can be practiced.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Abstract: The growth of collaborative activity is greatly influenced by the process of globalisation. This paper focuses on the narrow area of collaborative R&amp;D activity, and takes a `macro' view of the effects of these developments. Globalisation has affected the need of firms to collaborate, in that firms now seek opportunities to cooperate, rather than identify situations where they can achieve majority control. The use of collaboration is particularly acute in capital-intensive and knowledge-intensive sectors. These are also the sectors where firms have expanded internationally fastest, as they need to compete in various markets simultaneously, but also to exploit and acquire assets and technology that may be specific to particular locations. The increasing similarity of technologies across countries and cross-fertilisation of technology between sectors, coupled with the increasing costs and risks associated with innovation has led firms to consider R&amp;D alliances as a first-best option in many instances. This has important welfare implications and impinges directly on the industrial competitiveness of locations.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractLund (2002a) showed in a CAPM-type model how tax depreciation schedulesaffect required expected returns after taxes. Even without leverage higher tax ratesimplied lower betas when tax deductions were risk free. Here they are risky, andmarginal investment is taxed together with inframarginal in an analytical modelof decreasing returns. With imperfect loss offset tax claims are analogous to calloptions. The beta of equity is still decreasing in the tax rate, but increasing in theunderlying volatility. The results are important if market data are used to inferrequired expected returns, and in discussions of tax design.Keywords: Corporate tax, depreciation, imperfect loss offset, decreasing returns,cost of capital, uncertainty</dc:description>

					<dc:description>1. Brief IntroductionThe two companies D/S Svendborg and D/S 1912 have for almost a century been the parent companiesof the A.P. Møller Group. These companies were founded by Mr. Arnold Peter Møller and his fatherCaptain Peter Mærsk Møller. They were in the beginning entirely into shipping. In 1912, the fleetconsisted of 6 vessels.Much has happened since the company was founded: The A.P. Møller Group has by any standardsbecome the biggest company in Denmark. Moreover, `Svendborg' and `1912' have recently beenmerged into one company `A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S'. However, as we shall be concerned with theperformance of the company also in the past we will repeatedly make reference to the historic parentcompanies.As `Svendborg' and `1912' grew bigger they expanded into a number of other businesses. It iscommon to split the main businesses of the APM Group into three broad categories:</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Dette Working Paper kommer til at handle om, hvordan man egentlig kan finde på at arbejde med kritisk diskursanalyse og retorik på én gang, når nu diskursanalysen på den ene side hævder, at vi skal afsløre verdensanskuelser og magtforhold bag sprogbrug, og retorikken på den anden side er mere optaget af at fortælle os, hvordan vi skal styre og målrette vores sprogbrug i skabelsen af tekster.Hvis den kritiske diskursanalyse således repræsenterer ideer om, at mennesker og menneskelige relationer styres af normer, myter og kultur, og at det, vi skal stræbe efter, er at afsløre og dekonstruere dem for at imødegå faren for den totale kontrol, så er vel netop den klassiske retorik repræsentant for det modsatte, nemlig at vi skal operere inden for de afstukne grænser, som normerne og kulturen sætter, for bedst muligt at tale vores sag?Jeg vil her forsøge at vise, at denne fremstilling er for firkantet, og at den pointe, at sproget både skaber og skabes af mennesker og samfund i en dialektisk vekslen, er en hovedpointe i nutidige tilgange inden for både retorik og diskursanalyse. Ligeledes vil jeg argumentere for, at vi i vores private og professionelle virke både har brug for at 'pille tekster fra hinanden' og at vide, hvordan vi former dem på den mest hensigtsmæssige måde.Selv om jeg opererer med begreberne 'klassisk retorik' og 'kritisk diskursanalyse', er der ikke tale om, at jeg her hverken kan eller vil give nogen udtømmende, endsige grundig, gennemgang af nogen af områderne, ligesom jeg heller ikke vil forsøge at tage patent på, hvad hverken klassisk retorik eller kritisk diskursanalyse går ud på. Min artikel er blevet til på baggrund af mine egne beskedne erfaringer med begge områder, herunder mit empiriske arbejde med diskursanalyse af spanske avisartikler, hvor jeg anvender kritisk diskursanalyse a la Fairclough (1992, 1995).</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In many OECD countries, a seller has a right to reimbursement of VAT (RVAT) she has paid on goods sold, but for which she has not yet received payment. Such reimbursement of VAT on receivables is economically inefficient. It leads to:@* Distortion of credit markets, by subsidizing direct credit at the cost of financial intermediaries.@* Price discrimination, by subsidizing buyers with low creditworthiness.@* A less efficient collection of bad debts, as trade with bad debts is made extremely expensive.The finance literature presents several `good' arguments in favor of trade credits, e.g. transaction costs and asymmetric information. In contrast RVAT is an economically `bad' argument for trade credit. It is a subsidy that leads to inefficiently high use of trade credit.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>In recent years, the leading Japanese wireless operator NTT DoCoMo has risen frombeing largely unknown outside Japan to international fame. Ground-breaking serviceinnovations such as the world's first wireless internet service, I-mode, the world'sfirst third generation wireless service FOMA, as well as the company's successfulproliferation of its W-CDMA 3G technologies as the UMTS standard in Europe havegenerally impressed the troubled telecom industry on its brink to the new era wirelessdata services. Conversely, much scientism has been aired whether the NTT DoCoMoexperience applies to European and US contexts due to differences in e.g.demographics, Internet penetration, and wireless industry structures. To date, theseconsiderations have largely been based on anecdotal reports in trade magazines and anincreasing number of case studies focused primarily on the I-mode service (e.g.Mulder and Simpson (2001); Harvard (2000)). Notable, exceptions are Ratliff (2001)and Williamson and Meegan (2002) that however both point to the need for elevatinginsights on NTT DoCoMo. This working paper sets out to contribute to a moreelaborate picture of NTT DoCoMo.The working paper is outlined as follows. Departing from a sketch of DoCoMo'scurrent challenges from the perspective of the CEO Keiji Tachikawa as the financialyear 2003 is coming to an end (March 31 2003), a brief introduction to DoCoMo'shistory and its innovative capabilities initiates the effort to present a more detailedpicture of the company. Then, the normal perception of NTT DoCoMo as a de factomonopolist with all dominating market and bargaining power is challenged by meansof longitudinal study of the Japanese wireless market's development from 1992 to2003. During this period, DoCoMo's leadership position as increasingly beenchallenged by new competitors that emerged from an industry consolidation andregulatory forces. It is found that the nature of competition has shifted fromDoCoMo's undisputed dominance to a more dynamic environment signified byintense service innovation based competition. Then, insights are provided as how theNTT DoCoMo competes in its new environment. Three key strategic pillars areanalyzed, namely the company's to approaches the (1) orchestrating of innovationwith the examples of I-mode, C-mode, and Telematics services, (2) relationalchallenges with the examples of technology standardization alliances, interfirmrelationships with handset providers and internationalization partners, and lastly (3)how new growth avenues are explored.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Most studies of mergers and acquisitions have a managerial tilt and are founded on shortvisits to the companies investigated. This essay is based on a longitudinal study of a companythat experiences a series of international acquisitions, giving voice to a wide range oforganizational actors at different hierarchical levels, interviewed at different points of timeover a period of six years. The collected narrative interviews are viewed as retrospectiveinterpretations of change processes in the acquired company, made by organizational actorsas parts of the plots they are continually constructing and revising to make sense of thecourse of organizational actions and events. Greimas' actantial model is used to systematizethe different plots that can be seen as results of both individual and collective processes ofselection, hierarchization and sequencing of organizational actions and events. It is arguedthat a narrative approach is well suited to clarify changing patterns of identification andjustification and to display different modes of storytelling. The narratological analysesmoreover illustrate that even central actors within an acquired company often have suchdifferent work-views and world-views that it may be problematic or even counterproductive ifupper-level management introduces corporate storytelling through conscious efforts withoutany negotiation of the different versions of stories told by the employees.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>AbstractOver the last decade the Danish corporate environment has experienced a significant increase inthe use of option-based compensation (OBC). This and many other facts are documented in the presentpaper which provides the first insights into the characteristics of the option and warrant contracts issuedby the complete sample of Danish companies listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.A newly constructed database containing all publicly available information on details of DanishOBC contracts allows us to present, for example, results regarding contract values at an aggregated aswell as at firm, personnel group, and individual level. The paper also contains a section which discussesand presents evidence on the incentive effects provided by the option-based compensation contractsadopted by Danish listed companies.</dc:description>

					<dc:description>Artiklen er resultatet af en undersøgelse af 154 virksomhederforetaget indenfor et samlebegreb, der her benævnes 'ModerneØkonomistyrings-Værktøjer' (MØV). MØV omfatter her: ActivityBased Costing, Activity Based Management, target costing, lifecycle-costing, kaizen costing, Total Quality Management, ikkefinansielleperformance mål, quality costing, cost of engineering,strategic costing, Business Excellence Modellen, BalancedScorecard, videnregnskab, Economic Value Added, samtShareholder Value. Disse begreber er udvalgt, da de vurderes atvære de mest kendte og mest omdiskuterede såvel i teorien som ipraksis. De inkluderede værktøjer er således ikke udtømmende forlisten af nyere økonomistyringskoncepter og ledelsesmodeller. Dataer indsamlet ved hjælp af et spørgeskema udsendt dels postalt delsvia e-mails. Formålet har været at få en form for state-of-the-artviden på området. Dette betyder, at der kun er få forklarendevirksomhedsvariable inddraget. Undersøgelsen viser bl.a., atøkonomistyringen i disse år bevæger sig ind på nye områder, menat dette kun sker langsomt og med et rimeligt stort time-lag til følge,i forhold til hvornår et given koncept første gang blev eksponeret ilitteraturen. Et andet resultat er, at ABC og Balanced Scorecardrangerer på et højt niveau, når man ser på kendskab, hvorimodKaizen Costing og Strategic Costing ligger forholdsvist lavt, trodsdet faktum, at disse i teorien har været kendt i langt længere tid.Dog ser det ud til, at de sidstnævnte mere tekniske og mereveldefinerede koncepter umiddelbart giver en større nytte. Et tredjeresultat er, at trods relativt godt kendskab og en positiv holdning,er den konkrete anvendelse af koncepterne langt mindre end først antaget.</dc:description>

While it has been recognized that users may sometimes innovate, little is known aboutwhat commercial firms can do to motivate and capture such innovations and their related benefits. Wecontribute to the strategy literature by suggesting that learning and innovation efforts from which afirm may benefit need not necessarily be located within the organization, but may well reside in theconsumer environment. We also contribute to the existing theory on `user-driven innovation' byshowing what firms purposively can do to generate consumer innovation efforts. An explorative casestudy shows that consumer innovation can be structured, motivated, and partly organized by acommercial firm that lays out the infrastructure for interactive learning by consumers in a publicKeywords: Product Development, Consumer-to-Consumer Interaction, Learning, Consumer Innovation, Community, User-toolkits.

					<dc:description>Knowledge management has emerged as a very successful organization practice and has beenextensively treated in a large body of academic work. Surprisingly, however, organizationaleconomics (i.e., transaction cost economics, agency theory, team theory and property rightstheory) has played no role in the development of knowledge management. We argue thatorganizational economics insights can further the theory and practice of knowledge managementin several ways. Specifically, we apply notions of contracting, team production,complementaries, hold-up, etc. to knowledge management issues (i.e., creating and integrationknowledge, rewarding knowledge workers, etc.) , and derive refutable implications that are novelto the knowledge management field from our discussion.</dc:description>

					<dc:title>Knowledge Transfers following Acquisition : The Impact of Prior Trust-based Relations</dc:title>

					<dc:description>Prior relations between the acquiring firm and the target company pave the way for knowledge transfers subsequent to the acquisitions. One major reason is that through the market-based relations the two actors build up mutual trust and simultaneously they learn how to communicate. An empirical study of 54 Danish acquisitions taking place abroad from 1994 to 1998 demonstrated that when there was a high level of trust between the acquiring firm and the target firm before the take-over, then medium and strong tie-binding knowledge transfer mechanisms, such as project groups and job rotation, were used more intensively. Further, the degree of stickiness was significantly lower in the case of prior trust-based relations.</dc:description>
